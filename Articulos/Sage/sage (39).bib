abstract = {This research note describes ByrdBot, a science communication tool that leverages bird songs to communicate data regarding human impacts on the environment. With ByrdBot, listeners can compare simulated soundscapes of 1970, 2017, and 2065 to immediately, and viscerally, experience decades of past or projected future environmental change. The communication tactic of ByrdBot—what we call emergent sonification—is discussed as one that capitalizes on computational media to facilitate attunement to nonhuman voices and, subsequently, to offer an affective grasping of the impacts of such phenomena as habitat destruction and climate change on wildlife displacement and loss.}

abstract = {The social identity approach suggests that group prototypical individuals have greater influence over fellow group members. This effect has been well-studied offline. Here, we use a novel method of assessing prototypicality in naturally occurring data to test whether this effect can be replicated in online communities. In Study 1a (N = 53,049 Reddit users), we train a linguistic measure of prototypicality for two social groups: libertarians and entrepreneurs. We then validate this measure further to ensure it is not driven by demographics (Study 1b: N = 882) or local accommodation (Study 1c: N = 1,684 Silk Road users). In Study 2 (N = 8,259), we correlate this measure of prototypicality with social network indicators of social influence. In line with the social identity approach, individuals who are more prototypical generate more responses from others. Implications for testing sociopsychological theories with naturally occurring data using computational approaches are discussed.}

In contrast to previous studies, numerical simulations are performed with two popular commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) packages, CFX and FLOW-3D, both of which employ the volume of fluid (VOF) method. Comparison with previously published experimental and computational data and new experimental results reported here highlight the capabilities and limitations of the aforementioned packages.}

abstract = {Computational cognitive models of web-navigation developed so far have largely been tested only on mock-up websites. In this paper, for the first time, we compare and contrast the performance of two models, CoLiDeS and CoLiDeS+, on two real websites from the domains of technology and health, under two conditions of task difficulty, simple and difficult. We found that CoLiDeS+ predicted more hyperlinks on the correct path and had a higher path completion ratio than CoLiDeS. CoLiDeS+ found the target page more often than CoLiDeS, took more steps to reach the target page and was more ‘disoriented’ than CoLiDeS for difficult tasks. Difficult tasks in general for both models had less task success and lower path completion ratio, predicted less hyperlinks on the correct path, visited pages with lower mean LSA and took more steps to complete compared with simple tasks. Overall, inclusion of context from previously visited pages and implementation of backtracking strategies (which are both part of CoLiDeS+) led to better modelling performance. Suggestions to further improve the performance of these computational cognitive models on real websites are discussed.}

abstract = {Stainless steel alloys are widely used in many important applications but their production presents difficulties because they contain expensive chromium, which can be extensively oxidised during decarburisation to the very low carbon levels required. Modern stainless steelmaking largely avoids this problem by having two distinct stages and is therefore described as duplex practice. Molten high carbon stainless steel is produced in an electric arc furnace and then the melt is decarburised in an argon–oxygen converter or a vacuum oxygen decarburising converter. In this work, computational thermodynamics has been used to examine the major reactions occurring in the electric arc furnace and to show the effect of various process variables on chromium recovery. It was shown that significant oxidation of the scrap must occur during melting, and that subsequent carbon/oxygen injection initially oxidises some chromium, but then mostly oxidises the added carbon. Chromium was predicted to exist in the slag as CrO and CrO1·5 in almost equal proportions. Increasing the temperature should improve chromium recovery but results in less benefit than expected due to the decreasing activity coefficients of CrO and CrO1·5 and the increasing oxygen partial pressure. Ferrosilicon additions reduce chromium oxides from the slag, but much of the silicon simply dissolves into the steel. Computational thermodynamics is seen to be a very effective educational tool for gaining an understanding of smelting processes.}

abstract = {Designing integrated systems of humans and automation involves envisioning how work will be performed, how it is affected by technological capabilities, and what will be helpful to support system performance. This is challenging as interactions and dynamics can create emergent effects that are difficult to predict. This demonstration aims to demonstrate the power of computational simulation in designing, verifying, and validating integrated systems of humans and automation. The demo will include an introduction to the simulation framework Work Models that Compute (WMC) used for our ongoing research, how to develop a work model in WMC, a demo of the simulation, and a demo of postprocessing visualization to analyze the simulation results. The approach can be applied in all stages of system design. With an example in aviation, we show how we use computational modeling and simulation to evaluate the robustness of envisioned operations of humans working with automated systems.}

abstract = {The smelting of nickel laterite ores to ferronickel alloy is unique in extractive metallurgy. It treats feed that is very low grade with respect to the target metal and, as a result, produces much more waste slag than valuable metal product. The energy consumption per tonne of product is therefore high and requires sustained research and design development in an effort to improve the economics of laterite smelting. In this work, the main characteristics of nickel laterite smelting are reviewed, and then a simple and transparent computational thermodynamics model of the electric furnace smelting step is developed. This model predicts the nickel grade, nickel recovery and FeO content of the slag as functions of the iron recovery to ferronickel satisfactorily. It correctly predicts that the carbon and silicon contents in ferronickel increase sharply at high iron recoveries. However, in common with more sophisticated models, it incorrectly predicts the iron recovery at which this increase is observed in practice. It is concluded that the model provides an accessible and a satisfactorily accurate vehicle for understanding the relationships between process variables and process outcomes during nickel laterite smelting.}

abstract = {Theories are the core of any science, but many imprecisely stated theories in organizational and management science are hampering progress in the field. Computational modeling of existing theories can help address the issue. Computational models are a type of formal theory that are represented mathematically or by other formal logic and can be simulated, allowing theorists to assess whether the theory can explain the phenomena intended as well as make testable predictions. As an example of the process, Locke’s integrated model of work motivation is translated into static and dynamic computational models. Simulations of these models are compared to the empirical data used to develop and test the theory. For the static model, the simulations revealed largely strong associations with robust empirical findings. However, adding dynamics created several challenges to key precepts of the theory. Moreover, the effort revealed where empirical work is needed to further refine or refute the theory. Discussion focuses on the value of computational modeling as a method for formally testing, pruning, and extending extant theories in the field.}

This investigation analyses the aerodynamic performance of the canopy in airdrop testing combining the leading-edge incision and the trailing-edge deflection. Aerodynamic parameters of the canopy are obtained using the computational fluid dynamic simulations, and then, the output data are used to estimate the deflection and incision factors. The estimated lift and drag coefficients instead of the traditional parameters based on lifting-line theory are incorporated into the eight degrees of freedom dynamic model of an airdrop system and make some simulations. The effectiveness of the proposed method for calculating aerodynamic coefficients is verified by actual airdrop testing.}

abstract = {Robotics education has received widespread attention in K-12 education. Studies have pointed out that in robotics courses, learners face challenges in learning abstract content, such as constructing a robot with a good structure and writing programs to drive a robot to complete specific learning tasks. The present study proposed the embodied learning-based computer programming approach and applied it to the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robotics course. To evaluate its effectiveness, a quasi-experiment was conducted in one public primary school to explore its effects on students’ learning achievement, learning motivation, learning attitudes, learning engagement, and cognitive load. The experimental group (40 students) adopted the embodied learning-based computer programming approach, while the control group (40 students) adopted the conventional computer programming approach. The results showed that the experimental group had significantly better learning achievement in robotics than the control group, and that there was no significant difference in the cognitive load of the two groups. In terms of learning motivation, although both groups showed improvement, the experimental group had higher intrinsic learning motivation. In addition, the experimental group outperformed the control group with regard to learning attitudes and learning engagement (including cognitive, behavioral, and emotional engagement). Accordingly, this study could contribute to future research for developing more effective robotics teaching approaches and computer programming activity design.}
