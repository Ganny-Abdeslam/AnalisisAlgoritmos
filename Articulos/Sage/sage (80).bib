abstract = {Objectives: In the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment, the emergence of therapeutic failures with existing antiretroviral drugs presents a significant challenge. This study aims to employ advanced molecular modeling techniques to identify potential alternatives to current antiretroviral agents. Methods: The study focuses on three essential classes of antiretroviral drugs: nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs). Computational analyses were performed on a database of 3,343,652 chemical molecules to evaluate their binding affinities, pharmacokinetic properties, and interactions with viral reverse transcriptase and protease enzymes. Molecular docking, virtual screening, and 3D pharmacophore modeling were utilized to identify promising candidates. Results: Molecular docking revealed compounds with high binding energies and strong interactions at the active sites of target enzymes. Virtual screening narrowed down potential candidates with favorable pharmacological profiles. 3D pharmacophore modeling identified crucial structural features for effective binding. Overall, two molecules for class 1, 7 molecules for class 2, and 2 molecules for class 3 were selected. These compounds exhibited robust binding affinities, interactions with target enzymes, and improved pharmacokinetic properties, showing promise for more effective HIV treatments in cases of therapeutic failures. Conclusion: The combination of molecular docking, virtual screening, and 3D pharmacophore modeling yielded lead compounds that hold potential for addressing HIV therapeutic failures. Further experimental investigations are essential to validate the efficacy and safety of these compounds, with the ultimate goal of advancing toward clinical applications in HIV management.}

abstract = {A composite material (CM) of periodic structure with the peristatic properties of constituents, as proposed by Silling, is analyzed by a generalization of the classical locally elastic computational homogenization to its peristatic counterpart. New volumetric periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) are introduced at the interaction boundary of a representative unit cell (UC). A generalization of the Hill’s equality to peristatic composites is proved. The general results establishing the links between the effective moduli and the corresponding mechanical influence functions are obtained. The discretization of the equilibrium equation acts as a macro-to-micro transition of the deformation-driven type, where the overall deformation is controlled. Determination of the microstructural displacements allows one to estimate the peristatic traction at the geometrical UC’s boundary, which is exploited for estimation of the macroscopic stresses and the effective moduli. The proposed approach is demonstrated computationally through one-dimensional examples.}

abstract = {This article proposes that additional mathematical information, inherent and implicit within mathematical models of physical dynamic systems, can be extracted and visualized in a physically meaningful and useful manner as an adjunct to standard analytical modelling and solution. A conceptual methodology is given for a process of term-tracking within ordinary differential equation (ODE) models and solutions for engineering dynamics problems, and for a visualization based on a powerful new Mathematica implementation of the standard Tooltip graphical user interface facility. It is shown that the method is logical, generic, and unambiguous in its application, and that a useful visualization tool can be devised, and structured in such a way that the user can be given as much or as little information as is required to assimilate the problem to hand. The article shows by means of examples of code written expressly for the purpose that a term-tracking and visualization methodology can be constructed in a computationally effective manner within Mathematica and applied to a semi-automated variant of the method of multiple scales. It is implicitly obvious that this approach can therefore be applied to almost any algorithmic symbolic solution method, and therefore there could be physical applications which are potentially well beyond the chosen domain of non-linear engineering dynamics.}

abstract = {We address the problem of DOA estimation in positioning of nodes in wireless sensor networks. The Stochastic Maximum Likelihood (SML) algorithm is adopted in this paper. The SML algorithm is well-known for its high resolution of DOA estimation. However, its computational complexity is very high because multidimensional nonlinear optimization problem is usually involved. To reduce the computational complexity of SML estimation, we do the following work. (1) We point out the problems of conventional SML criterion and explain why and how these problems happen. (2) A local AM search method is proposed which could be used to find the local solution near/around the initial value. (3) We propose an algorithm which uses the local AM search method together with the estimation of DML or MUSIC as initial value to find the solution of SML. Simulation results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms. In particular, the algorithm which uses the local AM method and estimation of MUSIC as initial value has much higher resolution and comparable computational complexity to MUSIC.}

abstract = {A method for the solution of the three-dimensional structural dynamics equations with large strains using a finite volume technique is presented. The proposed solution procedure is second order accurate in space and employs a second-order accurate dual time-stepping scheme. The momentum conservation equations are written in terms of the Piola-Kirchhoff stresses. The stress tensor is related to the Lagrangian strain tensor through the St. Venant-Kirchhoff constitutive relationship. The structural solver presented is verified through two test cases. The first test case is a three-dimensional cantilever beam subject to a gravitational load that is verified using theory and two-dimensional simulations reported in literature. The second test case is a three-dimensional highly deformable cantilever plate subject to a gravitational load. The results of this case are verified through a comparison with the modal response calculated by commercially available software. The focus of the current effort is the development and verification of the structural dynamics portion of a future fully coupled monolithic fluid-thermal-structure interaction code package.}

abstract = {Clutter in tactical situation displays (TSD) is a persistent problem that affects pilots’ performance. Decluttering methods such as dimming, dotting, small-sizing and removal have been used in several display types to reduce clutter. This study aims to investigate the effects of different decluttering methods applied in TSD on pilots’ visual search performance. It also aims to uncover the basic psychophysical processes underlying the pilots’ visual search behavior through computational modeling. Data from fifteen Air-Force pilots showed that accuracy is higher and response time is faster when the TSD is decluttered, regardless of the technique. However, when the data was fitted into the hierarchical drift-diffusion model, it was revealed that among the techniques tested, dimming yielded the best search performance based on the model parameters. This study suggests that analyzing behavioral data through computational modeling may lead to better insights that are more practical and applicable in solving the issues in visual search in TSDs.}

abstract = {The overflow energy loss in relief valve, which is one of the main reasons leading to the low efficiency of the hydraulic system, had been considered to be impossible to solve. The principle of the overflow energy loss of the relief valve is analyzed and a novel method to reduce the overflow loss using an energy recovery unit, which can improve the return line pressure of the pilot proportional relief valve, is proposed. The influence of the energy recovery unit on the pressure control characteristics and steady-state flow force of the pilot proportional relief valve are discussed. The effects of the return line pressure on the distribution of the flow field and the pressure control characteristics are analyzed through computational fluid dynamics simulation and experiment. The results show that with the increase of the return line pressure, the displacement of the main valve spool increases and the reset spring force increases accordingly. While the steady-state flow force decreases dramatically with the increase of the return line pressure, which results in a smaller pressure differential the pressure differential can be reduced from 15% to 2.5%. It is also observed that the flow rate of the pilot proportional relief valve can be maintained at a certain value with a small oscillation and that the pilot proportional relief valve can release the redundant flow of hydraulic system. This verifies that the pilot proportional relief valve with the outlet connecting to the energy recovery unit to recovery the overflow energy loss cannot reduce the pressure control characteristics, but can achieve a better pressure control accuracy of the pilot proportional relief valve.}

abstract = {Gain modulation is a nonlinear way in which neurons combine information from two (or more) sources, which may be of sensory, motor, or cognitive origin. Gain modulation is revealed when one input, the modulatory one, affects the gain or the sensitivity of the neuron to the other input, without modifying its selectivity or receptive field properties. This type of modulatory interaction is important for two reasons. First, it is an extremely widespread integration mechanism; it is found in a plethora of cortical areas and in some subcortical structures as well, and as a consequence it seems to play an important role in a striking variety of functions, including eye and limb movements, navigation, spatial perception, attentional processing, and object recognition. Second, there is a theoretical foundation indicating that gain-modulated neurons may serve as a basis for a general class of computations, namely, coordinate transformations and the generation of invariant responses, which indeed may underlie all the brain functions just mentioned. This article describes the relationships between computational models, the physiological properties of a variety of gain-modulated neurons, and some of the behavioral consequences of damage to gain-modulated neural representations.}

We develop a strategy that uses simulated data to identify the conditions under which different methods perform well and applies what is learned from the simulations to predict which method will perform best on never-before-seen empirical data sets. We apply this strategy to a class of methods that group respondents to attitude surveys according to whether they share construals of a given domain. This allows us to identify the relative strengths and weaknesses of the methods we consider, including relational class analysis, correlational class analysis, and eight other such variants. Results support the “no free lunch” view that researchers should abandon the quest for one best algorithm in favor of matching algorithms to kinds of data for which each is most appropriate and provide direction on how to do so.}

abstract = {In Robotics Education (RE), the hands-on experience with troubleshooting problems is seen as a good catalyst to enhance the participants’ problem-solving skills. Based on the pedagogical technique of collaborative learning and pair programming, pair learning is an emerging and potential method in RE, which means that students collaborate in pairs to construct, build, and program a robot under scripted but switchable roles. As a special collaborative learning, can pair learning also improve students’ troubleshooting performance in RE? Therefore, we conducted a comparison experiment (pair learning versus individual learning) in two classes at a Robot Summer Camp for high school students. The results indicated that (a) in the process of learning making robot artifacts, students in pair learning group (PLG) had a higher success rate in troubleshooting than that of individual learning group (ILG), but failed in other indicators and (b) in the summative test, the troubleshooting performance of students in PLG was similar with that of ILG. The findings showed that, in terms of troubleshooting, collaborative (pair) learning does not always has the superiority over individual learning in RE, which implicates other factors to be explored in future research. Implications for teaching are also discussed in this exploratory study.}
