abstract = {Abstract The paper reviews experimental and computational research directed at improving the internal cooling of gas-turbine blades. While not the most glamorous area of gas-turbine aerothermodynamics, the improvements in overall thermal efficiency directly attributable to internal blade cooling arguably outstrip those achieved in any other area of jet-engine research. The cooling arrangements within a blade adopt three cooling strategies: impinging leading-edge jets, serpentine passages for the mid-blade section, and pin fins near the trailing edge. Progress in each of these areas is examined. Although, in the second of these areas, CFD studies have now become an essential weapon in the designer’s armoury, the other two still rely mostly on experimental research. Possible further developments are discussed.}

abstract = {Human-machine teams (HMTs) in complex work domains need to be able to adapt to variable and uncertain work demands. Computational modeling and simulation can provide novel approaches to the evaluation of HMTs performing complex joint activities, affording large-scale, quantitative analysis of team characteristics (such as system architecture and governance protocols) and their effects on resilience. Drawing from literature in resilience engineering, human-automation interaction, and cognitive systems engineering, this paper provides a theoretical exploration of the use of computational modeling and simulation to analyze resilience in HMTs. Findings from literature are summarized in a set of requirements that highlight key aspects of resilience in HMTs that need to be accounted for in future modeling and evaluation efforts. These requirements include a need to model HMTs as joint cognitive systems, the need to account for the interdependent nature of activity, the temporal dynamics of work, and the need to support formative exploration and inquiry. We provide a brief overview of existing modeling and simulation approaches to evaluating HMTs and discuss further steps for operationalizing the identified requirements.}

abstract = {In this work, a mean-line model with the row-by-row stacking scheme is developed to simulate the off-design operation of a multi-stage transonic axial compressor of an industrial gas turbine. A database of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation results validated with the field data is generated at different rotating speeds and pressure ratios by using CFD simulation tools and available detail geometry of the studied compressor. The compressor characteristic parameters including inlet/exit blockage factor, deviation angle parameter, rotor temperature and pressure coefficients, and the pressure loss of the stator for all stages, plus variable inlet guide vane, are extracted from CFD simulation results. Based on analytical/empirical relations in the literature, a generic formulation for the characteristic parameters is defined as a function of airflow parameters such as inlet Mach number, inlet flow angle, and velocity ratio. Since the accuracy of this type of model depends on the formulated characteristic parameters, and due to the error propagation potential of the sequential stacking solutions, a multi-objective optimization program is developed to specify the coefficients and exponent values of the generic formulations. The functionality of characteristic curves versus airflow parameters for different compressor rows is comprehensively investigated. The comparison between the results of the mean-line model and CFD simulations shows the high accuracy of the model. The developed model can be used in applications such as condition monitoring of in-service gas turbines, studying the effects of rescheduling the variable stator vanes, and investigating the wet compression process.}

abstract = {Following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010, a substantial body of research has focused on the development of computational tools and analytical frameworks for modeling oil spill events. Much of this work is dedicated to deepening our understanding of the interactions between oil, fragile ecosystems, and the environment, as well as the impacts of oil on human settlements which are vulnerable to spill events. These advances in oil spill modeling and associated analytics have not only increased the efficiency of spill interdiction and mitigation efforts, they have also helped to nurture proactive, versus reactive, response strategies and plans for local and regional stakeholders. The purpose of this paper is to provide a progress report on the wide range of computational tools, analytical frameworks, and emerging technologies which are necessary inputs for a complete oil spill modeling package. Specifically, we explore the use of relatively mature tools, such as dedicated spill modeling packages, geographic information systems (GIS), and remote sensing, as well emerging technologies such as aerial and aquatic drones and other in-situ sensing technologies. The integration of these technologies and the advantages associated with using a geographic lens for oil spill modeling are discussed.}

abstract = {Objective: This paper introduces a robust, real-time system for detecting driver lane changes. Background: As intelligent transportation systems evolve to assist drivers in their intended behaviors, the systems have demonstrated a need for methods of inferring driver intentions and detecting intended maneuvers. Method: Using a “model tracing” methodology, our system simulates a set of possible driver intentions and their resulting behaviors using a simplification of a previously validated computational model of driver behavior. The system compares the model’s simulated behavior with a driver’s actual observed behavior and thus continually infers the driver’s unobservable intentions from her or his observable actions. Results: For data collected in a driving simulator, the system detects 82% of lane changes within 0.5 s of maneuver onset (assuming a 5% false alarm rate), 93% within 1 s, and 95% before the vehicle moves one fourth of the lane width laterally. For data collected from an instrumented vehicle, the system detects 61% within 0.5 s, 77% within 1 s, and 84% before the vehicle moves one-fourth of the lane width laterally. Conclusion: The model-tracing system is the first system to demonstrate high sample-by-sample accuracy at low false alarm rates as well as high accuracy over the course of a lane change with respect to time and lateral movement. Application: By providing robust real-time detection of driver lane changes, the system shows good promise for incorporation into the next generation of intelligent transportation systems.}

abstract = {In a crosswind scenario, the risk of high-speed trains overturning increases when they run on viaducts since the aerodynamic loads are higher than on the ground. In order to increase safety, vehicles are sheltered by fences that are installed on the viaduct to reduce the loads experienced by the train. Windbreaks can be designed to have different heights, and with or without eaves on the top. In this paper, a parametric study with a total of 12 fence designs was carried out using a two-dimensional model of a train standing on a viaduct. To asses the relative effectiveness of sheltering devices, tests were done in a wind tunnel with a scaled model at a Reynolds number of 1 × 105, and the train’s aerodynamic coefficients were measured. Experimental results were compared with those predicted by Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations of flow, showing that a computational model is able to satisfactorily predict the trend of the aerodynamic coefficients. In a second set of tests, the Reynolds number was increased to 12 × 106 (at a free flow air velocity of 30 m/s) in order to simulate strong wind conditions. The aerodynamic coefficients showed a similar trend for both Reynolds numbers; however, their numerical value changed enough to indicate that simulations at the lower Reynolds number do not provide all required information. Furthermore, the variation of coefficients in the simulations allowed an explanation of how fences modified the flow around the vehicle to be proposed. This made it clear why increasing fence height reduced all the coefficients but adding an eave had an effect mainly on the lift force coefficient. Finally, by analysing the time signals it was possible to clarify the influence of the Reynolds number on the peak-to-peak amplitude, the time period and the Strouhal number.}

abstract = {This study investigated the computational cost associated with grammatical planning in sentence production. We measured people’s pupillary responses as they produced spoken descriptions of depicted events. We manipulated the syntactic structure of the target by training subjects to use different types of sentences following a colour cue. The results showed higher increase in pupil size for the production of passive and object dislocated sentences than for active canonical subject–verb–object sentences, indicating that more cognitive effort is associated with more complex noncanonical thematic order. We also manipulated the time at which the cue that triggered structure-building processes was presented. Differential increase in pupil diameter for more complex sentences was shown to rise earlier as the colour cue was presented earlier, suggesting that the observed pupillary changes are due to differential demands in relatively independent structure-building processes during grammatical planning. Task-evoked pupillary responses provide a reliable measure to study the cognitive processes involved in sentence production.}

abstract = {A multi-objective optimization framework is developed for design of submarine hull shape. Internal volume of the vehicle and its hydrodynamic drag are optimized by seamlessly integrating non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm and Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes solver in a single code. The methodology seeks a geometric shape with minimum drag and maximum volume satisfying the constraints on the geometric design parameters given by a 5-parameter formula that describes the submarine hull. The shape of the sail is not a part of the optimization process, and only its longitudinal location over the submarine hull is optimized. Two design optimization approaches are proposed, solved and compared. In the first approach, the combined hull–sail location is optimized, and in the second, the hull shape without sail is optimized first, and for this optimized hull shape, the sail location is optimized next. Our reported results show that the former approach yields significantly lower drag.}

abstract = {Is it possible to induce a mind-set that will affect relational thinking in a subsequent reasoning task involving unrelated materials? We investigated whether evaluating the validity of verbal analogies (Experiment 1a) or generating solutions for them (Experiment 1b) could induce a relational mind-set that would transfer to an unrelated picture-mapping task. The verbal analogies were based on either near or far semantic relations. We found that generating (but not evaluating) solutions for semantically distant analogies increased the proportion of relational mappings on the transfer task, even after we controlled for fluid intelligence and response time. Solving near analogies did not produce transfer. Generation of solutions to far analogies appears to provide a potent method for triggering a mind-set that can enhance relational thinking in a different task.}
