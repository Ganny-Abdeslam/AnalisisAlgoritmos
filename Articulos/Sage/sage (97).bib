abstract = {This study explores discourse features on Facebook pages of news organizations during the 2020 U.S. primary debates using a state-of-the-art machine-learning model. Informing the scholarly debate about the implications of strategic game reporting in online spaces, we find that it is not necessarily linked to uncivil discourse, yet it might deter from relevant conversations. Second, addressing fears about the undesired outcomes of uncivil talk, our data suggest that incivility can coexist with rational discourse in user comments, although this relationship is not pervasive. Implications of these results are discussed in the context of the role of hybrid media for political engagement during electoral campaigns.}

abstract = {From their common roots in Human Factors Engineering, Human-Centered Design and Cognitive Systems Engineering have drifted into distinct fields over the past three decades, each developing beneficial heuristics, design patterns, and evaluation methods for designing for individuals and teams, respectively. GeoHAI, a clinical decision support application for preventing hospital-acquired infection, has yielded positive results in early usability testing and is expected to test positively in supporting joint activity, which will be measured through the novel implementation of Joint Activity Monitoring . The design and implementation of this application provide a demonstration of the possibilities and necessities to unify the work of Human-Centered Design and Cognitive Systems Engineering when designing technologies that are usable and useful to individuals engaged in joint activity with machine counterparts and other people. We are calling this unified process Joint Activity Design, which supports designing for machines to be good team players.}

abstract = {Abstract Underbonnet simulations are proving to be crucially important within a vehicle development programme, reducing test work and time-to-market. While computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of steady forced flows have been demonstrated to be reliable, studies of transient convective flows in engine compartments are not yet carried out owing to high computing demands and lack of validated work. The present work assesses the practical feasibility of applying the CFD tool at the initial stage of a vehicle development programme for investigating the thermally driven flow in an engine bay under thermal soak. A computation procedure that enables pseudo time-marching CFD simulations to be performed with significantly reduced central processing unit (CPU) time usage is proposed. The methodology was initially tested on simple geometries and then implemented for investigating a simplified half-scale underbonnet compartment. The numerical results are compared with experimental data taken with thermocouples and with particle image velocimetry (PIV). The novel computation methodology is successful in efficiently providing detailed and time-accurate time-dependent thermal and flow predictions. Its application will extend the use of the CFD tool for transient investigations, enabling improvements to the component packaging of engine bays and the refinement of thermal management strategies with reduced need for in-territory testing.}

abstract = {The mixture formation and combustion process of a hydrogen direct-injection internal combustion engine is computed using a modified version of a commercial three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics code. The aim of the work is the evaluation of hydrogen laminar flame speed correlations and turbulent flame speed closures with respect to combustion of premixed and stratified mixtures at various levels of air-to-fuel equivalence ratio. Heat-release rates derived from in-cylinder pressure traces are used for the validation of the combustion simulations. A turbulent combustion model with closures for a turbulent flame speed is investigated. The value of the computed heat-release rates mainly depends on the quality of laminar burning velocities and standard of turbulence quantities provided to the combustion model. Combustion simulations performed with experimentally derived laminar flame speed data give better results than those using laminar flame speeds obtained from a kinetic scheme. However, experimental data of hydrogen laminar flame speeds found in the literature are limited regarding the range of pressures, temperatures and air-to-fuel equivalence ratios, and do not comply with the demand of high-pressure engine-relevant conditions.}

abstract = {We present a novel computational approach to optimizing the morphological design of robots. Our framework takes as input a parameterized robot design as well as a motion plan consisting of trajectories for end-effectors and, optionally, for its body. The algorithm optimizes the design parameters including link lengths and actuator placements whereas concurrently adjusting motion parameters such as joint trajectories, actuator inputs, and contact forces. Our key insight is that the complex relationship between design and motion parameters can be established via sensitivity analysis if the robot’s movements are modeled as spatiotemporal solutions to an optimal control problem. This relationship between form and function allows us to automatically optimize the robot design based on specifications expressed as a function of actuator forces or trajectories. We evaluate our model by computationally optimizing four simulated robots that employ linear actuators, four-bar linkages, or rotary servos. We further validate our framework by optimizing the design of two small quadruped robots and testing their performances using hardware implementations.}

This article is an effort to contribute to the slowly growing literature concerning the replication of agent-based computational models. We present a replication of Kollman, Miller, and Page’s model of Tiebout sorting. In that model, individual agents with heterogeneous preferences for government policies select among jurisdictions that offer the most satisfactory package of government services. This project makes three contributions to the literature. First, our successful replication provides the research community with a modernized version of that seminal model. Second, we confirm that earlier results with respect to the single jurisdiction setting are highly robust with respect to voter preferences, while the results for multiple jurisdiction settings are more sensitive. Finally, we demonstrate a technique for conducting sensitivity analyses that leverages a high-dimensional experimental design.}

abstract = {Fire is a critical risk in reinforced concrete (RC) structures and appropriate structural resistance against it has to be ensured. In this contribution, an approach using corotational layered beam finite elements is employed in which the cross-section temperature is derived from a low-cost closed form model, as opposed to the more commonly used fully computational thermal analysis. The effect of geometrical and material nonlinearities (constitutive behavior fitted to experimental data for concrete and steel), material degradation as a function of temperature rise, and the contributions of thermal, transient, and creep strains are incorporated in the structural analysis. The computational results are favorably compared to experimental data from the literature for an RC beam and for a larger RC frame. Taking benefit of the layered beam formulation offering local insight into the cross-sectional and material behavior, the relationship between the structural degradation and data extracted from the cross-sectional behavior is successfully established. Noteworthy originalities of the contribution are the use of ultimate strain and its evolution as a function of temperature for both materials and the explanation of the observed structural response in fire conditions from cross-sectional data.}

abstract = {Temporality is an important aspect of political discourse. Politicians and policymakers attempt to construct the past and the future to gain power, legitimize their policies, claim success for themselves and blame others. To make computational analysis of temporality more accessible, we develop a new methodology using a semisupervised machine-learning algorithm called Latent Semantic Scaling. Only with a set of common verbs in the past perfect and future tense as seed words, the algorithm estimates the temporality of all other words. We demonstrate that it can identify temporal orientation of English and German sentences from election manifestos around 60–70% accurately, which is comparable to the results from a recent study based on supervised machine-learning algorithms. We also apply it to Twitter posts by German political parties to reveal temporal orientation of policy issues.}

abstract = {In this article, a novel tray humidifier column for humidification dehumidification desalination was proposed. The performance of the humidifier column has been investigated with experimental and computational fluid dynamics simulations. The hydrodynamics and heat transfer characteristics of this tray humidifier has been studied. A stainless steel sieve tray with a rectangular cross section with a dimension of 20 × 50 cm was used in the experimental study. In computational fluid dynamics modeling, a transient three-dimensional model has been developed based on the volume of fluid framework by using standard k-epsilon model. The effect of air and seawater flow rate and inlet seawater temperature on the exit air temperature has been investigated. The results show that the humidifier effectiveness of the tray humidifier column varies between 0.67 and 0.87 depending on operating conditions. Then, tray column can be used in humidification dehumidification desalination systems with advantages such as compact equipment, low-pressure drop, and handling solids or other sources of fouling.}
