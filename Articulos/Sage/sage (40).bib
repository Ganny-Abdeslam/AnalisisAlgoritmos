abstract = {This article synthesizes a large body of research in the social and cognitive sciences to develop a distinctly cognitive understanding of political identity. Building on dual-process and computational theories of mind, the article defends three claims about the mental and behavioral implications of identity in political domains: (1) identity-based thinking is people’s default (often fast, automatic, and cognitively inaccessible) way of mentally representing politics and of drawing inferences based on those representations; (2) people are not limited to identity-based thinking and can sometimes learn to override it via slow, volitional, and conscious reasoning; and (3) the cognitive complexity of identity-based thinking is in-between the levels of mental sophistication that the Michigan and Rochester Schools in political science posit. This account of political identity illuminates, inter alia, why even low-information voters can quickly identify their political allies and opponents, why even high-information politicians can misperceive their constituents, why affective polarization has been increasing in the United States in recent decades, and why many normative theories of justice advise people to override identity-based thinking.}

abstract = {This study aims to contribute to the pertinent body of knowledge by examining the field of data literacy (DL) to better understand its trends and evolution, thematic clusters, relevant studies and the most productive authors and journals. The analysis of scientific literature indexed by Web of Science from 1980 to 2023 (n = 1704 items) combined co-occurrence (using VOSviewer) and co-citation (using CiteSpace) techniques based on the words in the title and abstract, as well as the keywords, authors and journals. There is evidence of four main trend topics (Data Literacy, Statistical Literacy, Data-based assessment and e-society) and six thematic clusters (Data Literacy, Statistical Literacy, Quantitative Literacy, Big Data, Data Science and Quantitative Skills). With DL emerging in 2011, the research initially focused on both quantitative and statistical literacy, and later (2012–2016) shifted toward applying statistical literacy to various disciplines. Since 2018, the use of data has led to the emergence of fields like big data and data science, resulting in progress being made in data literacy. The combination of the two analysis techniques offers complementary perspectives: co-word analysis reveals fields of application, and co-citation analysis shows the internal evolution of the discipline. This study evidences a significant increase in publications on DL, indicating its expansion to several disciplines and a promising, yet uncertain, future.}

abstract = {The emergent reflexive process, by which researchers in a computational humanities project work towards a viable organizational modality for interdisciplinary collaboration, is analyzed. Using the metaphor of decomposition, successful collaboration between computer scientists and humanities scholars can be seen to require a reflexive scrutiny — a decomposition — of the disciplinary research processes that are involved, thus allowing crucial differences with respect to typical ways of posing research questions, the role of data, and the rhythm of the research process to be highlighted. It is argued that the currently popular expectation towards data as a self-identical organizational unit tends to downplay the role of decomposition as practice and process. A European cyberinfrastructure initiative that tries to respect the specificities of scholarly practice in the humanities is critically assessed, reflecting in particular on the inherent tension between ‘mutual shaping’ of digital tools and their users on the one hand, and the policy interest in efficient, functionalist design principles on the other.}

abstract = {This study implemented and evaluated the innovative use of a performance-based assessment platform to support the development of self-regulated learning (SRL) in senior primary students as they completed programming tasks. We embedded SRL support features into a performance-based assessment platform as scaffolding to help the students implement problem-solving strategies. A mixed-methods approach was adopted to evaluate the intervention. The students’ perceptions of their SRL skills after working through the programming tasks were measured by a survey of 45 students. The quantitative results suggested that the students benefited from the performance-based assessment platform in developing their SRL skills. A thematic analysis of interview data from 20 students further indicated that the embedded SRL scaffolding and automatic marking function helped them to solve the programming tasks. The results demonstrate that a well-designed performance-based assessment platform with embedded SRL support can be an effective tool for developing students’ SRL. The qualitative results further revealed that algorithmic thinking is an aspect of programming for which students need more SRL support.}

abstract = {We developed a novel concept of endovascular thrombolysis that employs a vibrating electroactive polymer actuator. In order to predict the efficacy of thrombolysis using the developed vibrating actuator, enzyme (plasminogen activator) perfusion into a clot was analyzed by solving flow fields and species transport equations considering the fluid structure interaction. In vitro thrombolysis experiments were also performed. Computational results showed that plasminogen activator perfusion into a clot was enhanced by actuator vibration at frequencies of 1 and 5 Hz. Plasminogen activator perfusion was affected by the actuator oscillation frequencies and amplitudes that were determined by electromechanical characteristics of a polymer actuator. Computed plasminogen activator perfused volumes were compared with experimentally measured dissolved clot volumes. The computed plasminogen activator perfusion volumes with threshold concentrations of 16% of the initial plasminogen activator concentration agreed well with the in vitro experimental data. This study showed the effectiveness of actuator oscillation on thrombolysis and the validity of the computational plasminogen activator perfusion model for predicting thrombolysis in complex flow fields induced by an oscillating actuator.}

abstract = {Abstract Experimental data from internal combustion (IC) engines suggests that the use of proprietary computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes for the prediction of coolant-side heat transfer within IC engine coolant jackets often results in underprediction of the convective heat transfer coefficient. An experimental and computational study, based on a coolant gallery simulator rig designed specifically to reproduce realistic IC engine operating conditions, has been conducted to explore this issue. It is shown that the standard ‘wall function’ approach normally used in CFD models to model near-wall conditions does not adequately represent some features of the flow that are relevant in convective heat transfer. Alternative modelling approaches are explored to account for these shortcomings and an empirical approach is shown to be successful; however, the methodology is not easily transferable to other situations.}

abstract = {Several flow visualization techniques using the Lagran gian approach are proposed for analyzing the numerical solutions of unsteady flow fields computed by the Eu lerian approach. We show how these methods can be used to assess the validity of solutions and to extract the nature of the flow fields. The numerical algorithms for the flow solver and the flow visualization are introduced. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved using the extended MAC method and the compressible Euler equations are solved using the TVD MacCormack method. Most of the flow visualization methods are conventional. For vector fields, however, we introduce a particle tracing algorithm that is suitable for large amounts of numerical data. We present four flow visu alizations using these methods: flow past a circular cyl inder in two dimensions, shock wave propagation over a circular cylinder, flow past a sphere, and flow around an entire automobile.}

abstract = {Many accounts of civil war violence assume that a conflict’s master cleavage also explains the local occurrence of violence. Some scholars, however, have argued that violence is often the result of local cleavages and feuds, many of which may be unrelated to the conflict’s master cleavage. How is local violence related to the conflict’s master cleavage? Using a computational model, this paper studies an alliance mechanism proposed by Kalyvas (2006, The Logic of Violence in Civil War, Cambridge University Press), where macro-actors support local ones that fight on their behalf. While these alliances create a principal–agent problem, the model shows that they can raise the overall severity of the conflict and serve the interests of the macro-actor. However, the model also shows that these mechanisms work only under limited conditions. Alliances can increase the level of violence perpetrated in the interest of the macro-actor, but only if (a) the latter supports agents that have in the past fought along the master cleavage and if (b) this happens in rural areas. This emphasizes again the importance of the rural dimension in the study of civil war.}

abstract = {Increasing demands for high-performance screw pumps in oil and gas as well as other applications require deep understanding of the fluid flow field inside the machine. Important effects on the performance such as dynamic losses, influence of the leakage gaps and presence and extent of cavitation are difficult to observe by experiments. However, it is possible to study such effects using well-validated computational fluid dynamics models. The novel-structured numerical mesh consisting of a single-computational domain for moving screw pump rotors was developed to allow three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulation of such machine possible. Based on finite volume method, the instantaneous mass flow rates, rotor torque, local pressure field, velocity field and other performance indicators including the indicated power were predicted. A calculation model for the bearing friction losses was introduced to account for mechanical losses. The geometry of the inlet and outlet passages and piping system are taken into consideration to evaluate their influences on the pressure distribution and shaft power. The paper also shows the influence of rotor clearances on the pump performance. The computational fluid dynamics model was validated by comparing the numerical results with the measured performance obtained in the experimental test rig through the comprehensive experiment performed for a set of discharge pressures and rotational speeds. Validation includes comparison of mass flow rates, shaft power and efficiency under variety of speeds and discharge pressure. It has been found that the predicted results match well with the measurements. The results also showed that the radial clearances have larger influence on the mass flow rate than the interlobe clearance. The correct design of the flow passages within the screw pump plays significant role in minimizing required power consumption. The analysis presented in this paper contributes to better understanding of the working process inside the screw pump and offers a good reference to improve design and optimize such machines in terms of clearance selection, shape of the ports, piping system, etc. In future, this model will be used for analysis of cavitating flows and determining performance of other multiphase screw pumps.}

abstract = {Model uncertainty is pervasive in social science. A key question is how robust empirical results are to sensible changes in model specification. We present a new approach and applied statistical software for computational multimodel analysis. Our approach proceeds in two steps: First, we estimate the modeling distribution of estimates across all combinations of possible controls as well as specified functional form issues, variable definitions, standard error calculations, and estimation commands. This allows analysts to present their core, preferred estimate in the context of a distribution of plausible estimates. Second, we develop a model influence analysis showing how each model ingredient affects the coefficient of interest. This shows which model assumptions, if any, are critical to obtaining an empirical result. We demonstrate the architecture and interpretation of multimodel analysis using data on the union wage premium, gender dynamics in mortgage lending, and tax flight migration among U.S. states. These illustrate how initial results can be strongly robust to alternative model specifications or remarkably dependent on a knife-edge specification.}
