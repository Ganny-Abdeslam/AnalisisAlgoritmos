abstract = {Genetic variations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can cause susceptibility to cancer. Although thousands of genetic variants have been identified to be associated with different cancers, the molecular mechanisms of cancer remain unknown. There is not a particular dataset of relationships between cancer and SNPs, as a bipartite network, for computational analysis and prediction. Link prediction as a computational graph analysis method can help us to gain new insight into the network. In this article, after creating a network between cancer and SNPs using SNPedia and Cancer Research UK databases, we evaluated the computational link prediction methods to foresee new SNP-Cancer relationships. Results show that among the popular scoring methods based on network topology, for relation prediction, the preferential attachment (PA) algorithm is the most robust method according to computational and experimental evidence, and some of its computational predictions are corroborated in recent publications. According to the PA predictions, rs1801394-Non-small cell lung cancer, rs4880-Non-small cell lung cancer, and rs1805794-Colorectal cancer are some of the best probable SNP-Cancer associations that have not yet been mentioned in any published article, and they are the most probable candidates for additional laboratory and validation studies. Also, it is feasible to improve the predicting algorithms to produce new predictions in the future.}

abstract = {Our work with the Argus Prime (Schoelles & Gray, 2001) simulated task environment has uncovered a variety of strategies that subjects use, at least sometimes, during target acquisition. However, it is difficult to determine how well subjects implement these strategies and, if implemented, how much these strategies contribute to overall performance. Recently, we have adopted Byrne and Kirlik’s (2002) cognitive-ecological approach to determine what strategies work best in different task environments. In the work reported here, we took one computational cognitive model and, holding all else constant, swapped in and out alternative strategies for target acquisition. We then ran each of these simulated human users ten times through each of four interface conditions.}

abstract = {Despite the evolution of ventricular assist devices, ventricular assist device patients still suffer from complications due to the damage to blood by fluid dynamic stress. Since rotary ventricular assist devices are assumed to exert mainly shear stress, studies of blood damage are based on shear flow experiments. However, measurements and simulations of cell and protein deformation show normal and shear stresses deform, and potentially damage, cells and proteins differently. The aim was to use computational fluid dynamics to assess the prevalence of normal stress, in comparison with shear stress, in rotary ventricular assist devices. Our calculations showed normal stresses do occur in rotary ventricular assist devices: the fluid volumes experiencing normal stress above 10 Pa were 0.011 mL (0.092%) and 0.027 mL (0.39%) for the HeartWare HVAD and HeartMate II (HMII), and normal stresses over 100 Pa were present. However, the shear stress volumes were up to two orders of magnitude larger than the normal stress volumes. Considering thresholds for red blood cell and von Willebrand factor deformation by normal and shear stresses, the fluid volumes causing deformation by normal stress were between 2.5 and 5 times the size of those causing deformation by shear stress. The exposure times to the individual normal stress deformation regions were around 1 ms. The results clearly show, for the first time, that while blood within rotary ventricular assist devices experiences more shear stress at much higher magnitudes as compared with normal stress, there is sufficient normal stress exposure present to cause deformation of, and potentially damage to, the blood components. This study is the first to quantify the fluid stress components in real blood contacting devices.}

abstract = {In this study, a computational fluid dynamics analysis was performed on bio-inspired micro aerial vehicle scale rigid flapping wings. The computational fluid dynamics analysis used a compressible unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes solver with low-Mach number preconditioning to study the complex, highly vortical, three-dimensional flow of low aspect ratio flapping wings at micro aerial vehicle-scale Reynolds numbers. The wing was flapped at a constant 5 Hz flap frequency at a mean chord reference Reynolds number of 25,000. The flapping and pitching kinematics were set to match those of a previous experimental study resulting in a constant flap stroke of 107° at translational pitching angles of 40°, 50°, and 60°. The force and flowfield measurements of the previous flapping-wing experiment were used for the validation of the 3D computational fluid dynamics model. The objectives of this effort were to understand the unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms and their relation to force production and aerodynamic efficiency on a rigid wing undergoing an insect-type flapping motion with passive pitching kinematics. Overall, the computational fluid dynamics results showed good agreement with the measured experimental force data. Additionally, the computational fluid dynamics simulation was able to adequately predict the process of leading edge vortex formation and shedding observed during experimentation. A vorticity summation approach used to calculate the strength of the leading edge vortex from the experimental measurements and from the computational fluid dynamics predicted flowfields showed comparable results. The computational fluid dynamics results were utilized to further analyze the differences in the flowfield and leading edge vortex formation for the three pitch angles tested as well as the instantaneous aerodynamic loads and aerodynamic power.}

abstract = {A computational fluid dynamics model of a bicuspid aortic valve has been developed using idealised three-dimensional geometry. The aim was to compare how the orifice area and leaflet orientation affect the hemodynamics of a pure bicuspid valve. By applying physiologic material properties and boundary conditions, blood flow shear stresses were predicted during peak systole. A reduced orifice area altered blood velocity, the pressure drop across the valve and the wall shear stress through the valve. Bicuspid models predicted impaired blood flow similar to a stenotic valve, but the flow patterns were specific to leaflet orientation. Flow patterns developed in bicuspid aortic valves, such as helical flow, were sensitive to cusp orientation. In conclusion, the reduced opening area of a bicuspid aortic valve amplifies any impaired hemodynamics, but cusp orientation determines subsequent flow patterns which may determine the specific regions downstream from the valve most at risk of clinical complications.}

abstract = {This review focuses on the modeling of articular cartilage (at the tissue level), chondrocyte mechanobiology (at the cell level) and a combination of both in a multiscale computation scheme. The primary objective is to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of conventional models implemented to study the mechanics of the articular cartilage tissue and chondrocytes. From monophasic material models as the simplest form to more complicated multiscale theories, these approaches have been frequently used to model articular cartilage and have contributed significantly to modeling joint mechanics, addressing and resolving numerous issues regarding cartilage mechanics and function. It should be noted that attentiveness is important when using different modeling approaches, as the choice of the model limits the applications available. In this review, we discuss the conventional models applicable to some of the mechanical aspects of articular cartilage such as lubrication, swelling pressure and chondrocyte mechanics and address some of the issues associated with the current modeling approaches. We then suggest future pathways for a more realistic modeling strategy as applied for the simulation of the mechanics of the cartilage tissue using multiscale and parallelized finite element method.}

abstract = {Climate change has the potential to displace large populations in many parts of the developed and developing world. Understanding why, how, and when environmental migrants decide to move is critical to successful strategic planning within organizations tasked with helping the affected groups, and mitigating their systemic impacts. One way to support planning is through the employment of computational modeling techniques. Models can provide a window into possible futures, allowing planners and decision makers to test different scenarios in order to understand what might happen. While modeling is a powerful tool, it presents both opportunities and challenges. This paper builds a foundation for the broader community of model consumers and developers by: providing an overview of pertinent climate-induced migration research, describing some different types of models and how to select the most relevant one(s), highlighting three perspectives on obtaining data to use in said model(s), and the consequences associated with each. It concludes with two case studies based on recent research that illustrate what can happen when ambitious modeling efforts are undertaken without sufficient planning, oversight, and interdisciplinary collaboration. We hope that the broader community can learn from our experiences and apply this knowledge to their own modeling research efforts.}

abstract = {Little use is made of multiple processors available on current supercomputers (computers with a theoretical peak performance capability equal to 100 MFLOPS or more) to improve turnaround time in computational aerodynamics. The productivity of a computer user is directly related to this turnaround time. In a time-sharing environment, such improvement in this speed is achieved when multiple processors are used efficiently to execute an algorithm. We apply the concept of mul tiple instructions and multiple data (MIMD) through multitasking via a strategy that requires relatively minor modifications to an existing code for a single processor. This approach maps the available memory to multiple processors, exploiting the C-Fortran-Unix interface. The existing code is mapped without the need for devel oping a new algorithm. The procedure for building a code utilizing this approach is automated with the Unix stream editor.}

abstract = {The aim of this study is to investigate the use of computational fluid dynamics in predicting the performance and geometry of the optimal design of a steam ejector used in a steam turbine. Many scholars have analysed the steam ejector using the ideal gas model, which lacks accuracy in terms of calculating the flow field of the ejector. This study is reported in a series of two papers. The first part covers the validation of CFX 11.0 results using different equations of state (EOS) on the converging–diverging nozzle flow field carried out with the experimental value. The IAPWS IF97 real gas model works well with the experimental value. The flow field of the ejector was analysed using different EOS after grid-dependent learning. The results show that the performance of the ejector was underestimated under the ideal gas model; the entrainment ratio was 20–40 per cent lower than when using the real gas model. The effect of the optimal geometrical design and operating conditions will be discussed in Part 2.}

abstract = {A theoretical computational method to evaluate the performance characteristics of cycloidal propellers is presented. Starting from Taniguchi’s method, improvements have been derived to make it applicable for various eccentricities in the whole advance coefficient region. First the effect of the curved orbit of the blades and the blade rotation is taken into account, that influences camber and zero lift angle. Then the effect of low Reynolds number on drag coefficient and the effect of stalling on lift coefficient are analysed and discussed in detail. Some linearizations are given up to improve the computation accuracy. The improved method is described. Using this improved method to compute the performance of a DTNSRDC model and comparing the results with systematic experiment results (see DTNSRDC Report 2983), it is shown that the agreement between them is quite good for a larger range of advance ratios and eccentricities.}
