abstract = {In computational fluid dynamics models for hemodynamics applications, boundary conditions remain one of the major issues in obtaining accurate fluid flow predictions. For major cardiovascular models, the realistic boundary conditions are not available. In order to address this issue, the whole computational domain needs to be modeled, which is practically impossible. For simulating fully developed turbulent flows using the large eddy simulation and dynamic numerical solution methods, which are very popular in hemodynamics studies, periodic boundary conditions are suitable. This is mainly because the computational domain can be reduced considerably. In this study, a novel periodic boundary condition is proposed, which is based on mass flow condition. The proposed boundary condition is applied on a square duct for the sake of validation. The mass-based condition was shown to obtain the solution in 15% less time. As such, the mass-based condition has two decisive advantages: first, the solution for a given Reynolds number can be obtained in a single simulation because of the direct specification of the mass flow, and second, simulations can be made more quickly.}

abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases persist as a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, despite significant advances in diagnostic and surgical approaches. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) represents a branch of fluid mechanics widely used in industrial engineering but is increasingly applied to the cardiovascular system. This review delves into the transformative potential for simulating cardiac surgery procedures and perfusion systems, providing an in-depth examination of the state-of-the-art in cardiovascular CFD modeling. The study first describes the rationale for CFD modeling and later focuses on the latest advances in heart valve surgery, transcatheter heart valve replacement, aortic aneurysms, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The review underscores the role of CFD in better understanding physiopathology and its clinical relevance, as well as the profound impact of hemodynamic stimuli on patient outcomes. By integrating computational methods with advanced imaging techniques, CFD establishes a quantitative framework for understanding the intricacies of the cardiac field, providing valuable insights into disease progression and treatment strategies. As technology advances, the evolving synergy between computational simulations and clinical interventions is poised to revolutionize cardiovascular care. This collaboration sets the stage for more personalized and effective therapeutic strategies. With its potential to enhance our understanding of cardiac pathologies, CFD stands as a promising tool for improving patient outcomes in the dynamic landscape of cardiovascular medicine.}

abstract = {The British government is claiming digital skills will deliver economic growth to the country and social mobility to young people: its ministers call it ‘a pipeline to prosperity’. While declaring this pipeline, the government assumes the needs of the economy and young people’s needs are (or should be) synchronised. We challenge this assumption and the policy it sustains with data from questionnaires, workshops and interviews with 50 young people from communities in South Wales (including a former mining town and a deprived inner city area) about digital technology’s role in their everyday life. We use a new typography to compare the reality of their socially and economically structured lives to the governmental policy discourse that makes them responsible for their country’s future economic success. To explain these young people’s creative and transgressive use of technology, we also make an empirically grounded contribution to the ongoing theoretical debates about structure and agency.}

abstract = {a. In 1973, the Department of Defense (DoD) created the Office of Net Assessment (ONA) with a charter and unique approach to strategic analysis. This approach questioned the suitability of systems analysis to assess long-term, dynamic competition between complex military organizations, and turned to more qualitative methods as analytic alternatives. Developments in computing technology and modeling methods over the last two decades, most notably agent-based modeling (ABM), provide new opportunities to address the central analytic questions that motivated the original development of net assessment as a distinctive practice of strategic analysis. By employing ABM to simulate and analyze the behavior of strategic, adaptive, boundedly rational actors, which have previously frustrated mathematical analysis, a new generation of computational models can provide opportunities to add rigor to net assessment.}

However, most of these studies are based on closed-ended survey research, which does not allow researchers to gain a more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon. This study integrated survey analysis conducted within the United States with computational text analysis to reveal factors previously obscured by traditional survey methodologies. Even after controlling for political ideology—which has been the most significant explanatory factor in determining trust in science within a survey framework—we found those with concerns over boundary-crossing (i.e. concerns or perceptions that science overlaps with politics, the government, and funding) were less likely to trust science than their counterparts.}

abstract = {Aerodynamics research in cycling has underpinned innovative bicycle design, new refined riding positions and optimised rider apparel. There has been a rise in the level of aerodynamics research focused on cycling since the turn of the millennium, enabled by significant increases in computational power and the availability of software/hardware. However, cycling research has not yet fully embraced para-cycling, with limited studies conducted on the aerodynamic performance of hand-cyclists and other para-cyclists. Wind tunnel experiments and computational fluid dynamics simulations were conducted in this research for the analysis of hand-cycling aerodynamics, focused on competitive H1–H4 category hand-cyclists. A quarter-scale representative geometry of a hand-cyclist was used in high-speed wind tunnel experiments. The accuracy of the simulations performed with the three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations was found to be dependent on the turbulence model choice and near-wall grid resolution. Computational fluid dynamics simulations predicted the magnitude of the drag and lateral forces to an accuracy of 2.5% using the shear stress transport turbulence model. This study also presents the impact of wheel diameter and disc wheels on hand-cycling aerodynamics via computational fluid dynamics simulations, providing a deeper understanding of the aerodynamic characteristics unique to the hand-cycling discipline in the sport of competitive cycling. Drag reductions of up to 8.9% were found when utilising 20-inch diameter spoked wheels, opposed to the 26-inch wheels. Variations in wheel diameter between the front and rear wheels were found to have a significant impact on the CDA in part through altering the pitch angle of the hand-cycle.}

abstract = {Predictive toxicology plays a critical role in reducing the failure rate of new drugs in pharmaceutical research and development. Despite recent gains in our understanding of drug-induced toxicity, however, it is urgent that the utility and limitations of our current predictive tools be determined in order to identify gaps in our understanding of mechanistic and chemical toxicology. Using recently published computational regression analyses of in vitro and in vivo toxicology data, it will be demonstrated that significant gaps remain in early safety screening paradigms. More strategic analyses of these data sets will allow for a better understanding of their domain of applicability and help identify those compounds that cause significant in vivo toxicity but which are currently mis-predicted by in silico and in vitro models. These ‘outliers’ and falsely predicted compounds are metaphorical lighthouses that shine light on existing toxicological knowledge gaps, and it is essential that these compounds are investigated if attrition is to be reduced significantly in the future. As such, the modern computational toxicologist is more productively engaged in understanding these gaps and driving investigative toxicology towards addressing them.}

abstract = {We review recent evidence revealing that the mere willingness to engage analytic reasoning as a means to override intuitive gut feelings is a meaningful predictor of key psychological outcomes in diverse areas of everyday life. For example, those with a more analytic thinking style are more skeptical about religious, paranormal, and conspiratorial concepts. In addition, analytic thinking relates to having less traditional moral values, making less emotional or disgust-based moral judgments, and being less cooperative and more rationally self-interested in social dilemmas. Analytic thinkers are even less likely to offload thinking to smartphone technology and may be more creative. Taken together, these results indicate that the propensity to think analytically has major consequences for individual psychology.}

This module was redesigned accordingly after the professor participated in a faculty development course, Engineering Education Theory and Practice, at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto. Student perspectives on the efficacy of the redesigned course were solicited, along with those from students who had previously taken the course. Students who participated in the revised course module reported higher levels of satisfaction than students from the previous iteration of the course and were more likely to recognize the value of specific instructional activities. This paper describes the revision of the course module and a comparison of the student feedback before and after those revisions.}

abstract = {Background: Although the abnormal depositions of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), converging evidence shows that the individual’s neurodegeneration trajectory is regulated by the brain’s capability to maintain normal cognition. Objective: The concept of cognitive reserve has been introduced into the field of neuroscience, acting as a moderating factor for explaining the paradoxical relationship between the burden of AD pathology and the clinical outcome. It is of high demand to quantify the degree of conceptual cognitive reserve on an individual basis. Methods: We propose a novel statistical model to quantify an individual’s cognitive reserve against neuropathological burdens, where the predictors include demographic data (such as age and gender), socioeconomic factors (such as education and occupation), cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and AD-related polygenetic risk score. We conceptualize cognitive reserve as a joint product of AD pathology and socioeconomic factors where their interaction manifests a significant role in counteracting the progression of AD in our statistical model. Results: We apply our statistical models to re-investigate the moderated neurodegeneration trajectory by considering cognitive reserve, where we have discovered that 1) high education individuals have significantly higher reserve against the neuropathology than the low education group; however, 2) the cognitive decline in the high education group is significantly faster than low education individuals after the level of pathological burden increases beyond the tipping point. Conclusion: We propose a computational proxy of cognitive reserve that can be used in clinical routine to assess the progression of AD.}
