abstract = {Abstract A computational study has been conducted to analyse the performance of a centrifugal compressor with different types of diffusers under various levels of impeller—diffuser interactions. Vaneless (VLD), vaned (VD), low solidity vaned (LSVD), and partial vaned diffusers (PVD) are used for this purpose. The study is carried out using commercial software ANSYS CFX. The interaction level is varied by varying the radial gap between the impeller and diffuser by keeping the diffuser vane at three different radial locations. Numerical simulations have been conducted for four different flow coefficients. At design flow coefficient maximum efficiency occurs when the leading edge is at R3 (ratio of radius of the diffuser leading edge to the impeller tip radius) = 1.10 for all vane-type diffuser configurations. At below design flow coefficient higher stage efficiency occurs when the diffuser vanes are kept far away (R3 = 1.15) and at above design flow coefficient R3 = 1.05 gives better efficiency. The highest diffuser pressure recovery coefficient (Cp) is observed for VD at design flow coefficient. For VLD, the Cp value increases with flow coefficient. In the case of VD and LSVD configurations the exit flow from the impeller is disturbed when the diffuser vanes are closer, and these disturbances are more evident in the last 10 per cent of the impeller flow. In the case of the impeller with PVD the interaction effects are minimum.}

abstract = {This paper discusses the possibility of using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to assess the influence of aerodynamic forces (aerodynamic uplift) on the mean contact force acting between a pantograph and the contact wire. The analysis consists of experimental tests and CFD simulations, performed in both wind tunnel and on-track scenarios. A method for the computation of the aerodynamic uplift and for the assessment of the contact force imbalance between the leading and trailing collectors is proposed. The method is based on the virtual work principle, and exploits both the numerical forces resulting from CFD analysis, and the Jacobian terms obtained from a kinematic analysis of the pantograph. The proposed model takes into account stationary phenomena, and it is fully validated by means of experimental results.}

abstract = {Contemporary education policy involves the integration of novel forms of data and the creation of new data platforms, in addition to the infusion of business principles into school governance networks, and intensification of socio-technical relations. In this paper, we examine how ‘computational rationality’ may be understood as intensifying of an instrumental set of logics in educational governance and decision making, and/or as opening up new explorations around the uncertainty and incompleteness of policy. We suggest that policy rationalities focused on prediction, transparency and data provide the conditions of possibility for Artificial Intelligence to be integrated into, and intensify aspects of, what we term ‘computational education policy’.}

abstract = {Previous investigators have suggested that the personality variable tolerance for error is related to success in computational estimation. However, this suggestion has not been tested directly. This study examined the relationship between performance on a computational estimation test and scores on the NEO–Five Factor Inventory, a measure of the Big Five personality traits, including Openness, an index of tolerance for ambiguity. Other variables included SAT–I Verbal and Mathematics scores and self-rated mathematics ability. Participants were 65 college students. There was no significant relationship between the tolerance variable and computational estimation performance. There was a modest negative relationship between Agreeableness and estimation performance. The skepticism associated with the negative pole of the Agreeableness dimension may be important to pursue in further understanding of estimation ability.}

abstract = {The overhead multiple outlets ventilation duct system of 18 m long is used to maintain the specified indoor thermal comfort environment for each railway passenger car. Therefore, the flow uniformity of the overhead ventilation duct system is very important for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning performance of a train. In this study, design optimization was conducted to increase the flow uniformity of the overhead ventilation duct system for a train by combining computational fluid dynamics and design of experiment methods. To perform the study, the flow uniformity of the base model was evaluated using numerical analysis whose reliability was verified. Design parameters of the overhead ventilation duct system were selected, and an effectiveness evaluation was performed for each design parameter by using 2k factorial design. Based on the results of the effectiveness evaluation for the design parameters, optimum models having improved flow uniformity were designed using the response surface method. The performances of the optimum models were also evaluated by the same numerical analysis that was applied to the base model. The flow uniformity of the optimum models was improved by controlling the opening ratios of the perforated plates and guide vane shape. In addition, nonuniform flow components locally existing in the base model were suppressed.}

abstract = {The heat pipes in solar applications uses are important and it is significantly growing nowadays. Capable of meeting the world’s challenges with a threat to the climate; a shortage of conventional energy sources, usually fossil fuels, high electricity costs, and it is inexpensive; therefore, the renewable energy of solar energy is an excellent source, reaching total amount of energy is 34,00,000 EJ in each year, all over the world. This is between 7000 and 8000 times the annual global primary energy consumption. Thereby, a Concentrating Solar Parabolic Trough Collector is suggested in this paper, which can be used to analyze the performance of various heat pipes. Using solar parabolic trough collector to analyze the performance of different heat pipes rather than considering the supply of electric power input. Using a parabolic trough collector that concentrates solar energy on an evacuated tube heat pipe, which converts radiation energy into electrical energy heat, the experimental work demonstrates the use of solar energy. Condensers, evaporators, and three heat pipes consisting of aluminum galvanized iron, and stainless steel materials are the main components. A porous wick structure and an ammonia solution-filled working fluid consist of each heat pipe. Continuously recirculating the working fluid through temperature variation. The readings are taken using connected thermocouples on three heat pipes by continuously varying the mass flow rate. The vacuum pressure gauge to maintain the heat pipes generates the vacuum inside space. At various mass flow rates of heated water from the parabolic trough collector, experimentation was also performed. The result of this study calculates the mass flow rate at the end of the process of the different heat pipes used here. Furthermore, different inclinations are estimated in a variety of situations, such as at temperatures of 15°, 30°, 45°, and 60°. In the experimental analysis, outlet temperatures of heat pipes are measured and the temperature distribution contours are evaluated using the analysis of computational fluid dynamics.}

abstract = {Computational cognitive models typically focus on individual behavior in isolation. Models frequently employ closed-form solutions in which a state of the system can be computed if all parameters and functions are known. However, closed-form models are challenged when used to predict behaviors for dynamic, adaptive, and heterogeneous agents. Such systems are complex and typically cannot be predicted or explained by analytical solutions without application of significant simplifications. In addressing this problem, cognitive and social psychological sciences may profitably use agent-based models, which are widely employed to simulate complex systems. We show that these models can be used to explore how cognitive models scale in social networks to calibrate model parameters, to validate model predictions, and to engender model development. Agent-based models allow for controlled experiments of complex systems and can explore how changes in low-level parameters impact the behavior at a whole-system level. They can test predictions of cognitive models and may function as a bridge between individually and socially oriented models.}

abstract = {We describe some of the ways that the field of content analysis is being transformed in an Era of Big Data. We argue that content analysis, from its beginning, has been concerned with extracting the main meanings of a text and mapping those meanings onto the space of a textual corpus. In contrast, we suggest that the emergence of new styles of text mining tools is creating an opportunity to develop a different kind of content analysis that we describe as a computational hermeneutics. Here the goal is to go beyond a mapping of the main meaning of a text to mimic the kinds of questions and concerns that have traditionally been the focus of a hermeneutically grounded close reading, a reading that focuses on what Kenneth Burke described as the poetic meanings of a text. We illustrate this approach by referring to our own work concerning the rhetorical character of US National Security Strategy documents.}

abstract = {In this work, the authors present a two-dimensional computational model for predicting the aeroelastic response as well as the output power of vertically arranged harvesters by taking into account all aerodynamic interactions. The piezo-aeroelastic framework consists of the following: (1) an aerodynamic model based on the unsteady vortex-lattice method to compute the aerodynamic forces; (2) a discrete parameter model for each harvester with 3 degrees of freedom (plunge motion, pitch motion, and the voltage generated by the piezoelectric effect); (3) an inter-model connection to exchange information between models at each time step; and (4) a numerical scheme based on the Hamming’s fourth-order predictor–corrector method to integrate all the governing equations in the time domain. The results obtained allow us to infer new insights into the flutter onset as well as the post-critical behavior of harvester arrangements. An interesting finding is that the flutter speed is significantly decreased as the distance between the harvesters is reduced. The results suggest the strong possibility of effective energy extraction at low flow speeds using properly distributed harvester arrangements. However, in post-critical conditions, the output power is significantly enhanced as the free-stream speed is increased.}

abstract = {The three-dimensional time-domain computational fluid dynamics approach is employed to calculate and analyze the sound attenuation behavior of water-filled perforated pipe silencers. Transmission loss predictions from the time-domain computational fluid dynamics approach and the frequency-domain finite element method agree well with each other for the straight-through and cross-flow perforated pipe silencers without flow. Then, the time-domain computational fluid dynamics approach is used to investigate the effects of flow velocity, diameter, and porosity of orifices on the sound attenuation behavior of the silencers. The numerical predictions demonstrate that the flow increases the transmission loss, especially at high frequencies. Based on the above analysis, partially plugged straight-through perforated pipe silencer is proposed to improve the sound attenuation performance by increasing the flow velocity through the orifices. In order to eliminate the pass frequency of the perforated pipe silencers and improve the sound attenuation performance in mid- to high-frequency range, a folded straight-through perforated pipe silencer is designed and its sound attenuation behavior is analyzed numerically using the time-domain computational fluid dynamics approach.}
