abstract = {Reversible phosphorylation maintained by protein kinases and phosphatases is an integral part of intracellular signalling, and phosphorylation on tyrosine is extensively utilised in higher eukaryotes. Tyrosine phosphatases are enzymes that not only scavenge phosphotyrosine but are also involved in wide range of signalling pathways. As a result, mutations in these enzymes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases like cancer, autoimmune disorders, and muscle-related diseases. The genes that harbour phosphatase domain also display diversity in co-existing domains suggesting the recruitment of the catalytic machinery in diverse pathways. We have examined the current draft of the human genome, using a combination of 3 sequence search methods and validations, and identified 101 genes encoding tyrosine phosphatase-containing gene products, agreeing with previous reports. Such gene products adopt 37 unique domain architectures (DAs), including few new ones and harbouring few co-existing domains that have not been reported before. This semi-automated computational approach for detection of gene products belonging to a particular superfamily can now be easily applied at whole genome level on other mammalian genomes and for other protein domains as well.}

abstract = {Background According to the Committee on STEM Education, K-12 science students need access to learning experiences that promote collaboration and engagement. To fill that void, we need to develop activities that stimulate engaged learning and scaffold effective collaboration. K-12 teacher candidates see value in utilizing games for this purpose. Specifically, tabletop science games can help teachers engage students in science learning and scaffold collaboration. Aim For this study, we designed a collaborative, STEM-themed card game called MOUNTAIN RESCUE and explored its capacity to promote engaged learning and collaboration. Method Four groups of STEM campers (n = 14) in a suburban Mid-Atlantic region played MOUNTAIN RESCUE. All groups had a mix of boys and girls. Play-testers ranged from 10–13 years old. The tabletop game took approximately 30-minutes. During gameplay, players embodied unique STEM roles: physicist, chemist, structural engineer, and electrical engineer. They collaborated to solve challenges related to electricity, physics, chemistry, and engineering design. Discourse was audio-recorded throughout gameplay. Immediately after gameplay, self-report survey data were collected to assess flow and perceptions of collaborative learning. Results Findings demonstrated that the game promoted engagement and collaboration. Specifically, students had a flow-like experience and felt positively about the game’s value for collaborative learning. Utterances demonstrating active engagement and constructive thinking became more group-focused over time. Conclusion This study contributes to science education by demonstrating potential benefits of a well-designed, low-tech, science learning environment or—in other words—a tabletop game.}

abstract = {In this work, experimental and theoretical analyses of the power losses in an industrial planetary speed reducer were performed in order to define the weight of the different types of power losses in the global efficiency as well as to understand the appropriateness and the effectiveness of the models and tools available in the literature for the prediction of these power losses. From this investigation, it has emerged that even if for all the kinds of power losses improvements are in principle possible, those for which, at the same time, more improvements seem possible and effective models are lacking are the load-independent power losses. For this reason, a computational fluid dynamics methodology able to evaluate load-independent gear power losses in planetary gearboxes is proposed. The other types of power losses were determined by means of analytical models available in the literature and, together with the calculated load-independent gear power losses, compared with the experimentally determined power losses showing the effectiveness of the adopted calculation models.}

In this short essay, I discuss these opportunities with respect to four topics: (1) processes of mediation and representation, (2) systems perspectives on creative work, (3) methodological options for investigation, and (4) educational challenges that should be addressed. Considering design research’s contributions to each of these topics raises interesting questions that possibility studies might address as it develops. Conversely, possibility studies is already raising issues that design research should also attend to.}

abstract = {Recital 33 GDPR has often been interpreted as referring to ‘broad consent’. This version of informed consent was intended to allow data subjects to provide their consent for certain areas of research, or parts of research projects, conditional to the research being in line with ‘recognised ethical standards’. In this article, we argue that broad consent is applicable in the emerging field of Computational Social Science (CSS), which lies at the intersection of data science and social science. However, the lack of recognised ethical standards specific to CSS poses a practical barrier to the use of broad consent in this field and other fields that lack recognised ethical standards. Upon examining existing research ethics standards in social science and data science, we argue that they are insufficient for CSS. We further contend that the fragmentation of European Union (EU) law and research ethics sources makes it challenging to establish universally recognised ethical standards for scientific research. As a result, CSS researchers and other researchers in emerging fields that lack recognised ethical standards are left without sufficient guidance on the use of broad consent as provided for in the GDPR. We conclude that responsible EU bodies should provide additional guidance to facilitate the use of broad consent in CSS research.}

abstract = {Abstract This article presents an investigation of the relative importance of key design parameters of a horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) blade. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used as the main tool, after validation against experimental data of the (National Aeronautics and Space Administration/National Renewable Energy Laboratory) NREL/NASA-Ames Phase VI wind tunnel campaign. Tip and root sections, blade aspect ratio, and pitch angle were analysed and all CFD calculations were performed using a compressible Reynolds-averaged Navier—Stokes solver. CFD grids of advanced multi-block topologies were used including up to 4.5 million cells. A grid convergence study indicated that a resolution of 3.4 million cells was adequate for the selected flow conditions, which correspond to an upwind wind turbine at 0° yaw angle, 7 m/s wind speed, and 72 r/min rotational speed. Various root and tip configurations were considered and the results obtained indicate that the exact representation of the root and tip geometry of an HAWT has a small but finite effect in the thrust and torque levels at working conditions. This effect is however secondary to the effects of aspect ratio and blade pitch.}

abstract = {This article offers a longitudinal computational-rhetorical analysis of biomedical writing on opioids. Using a corpus of 1,467 articles and essays published in the New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the American Medical Association between 1959 and May 2019, this study evaluates diachronic shifts in (a) the framing of opioid pharmacology, (b) the relative attention paid to pain management versus opioid dependence risks, and (c) the distribution of statements related to physicians’ primary ethical obligations. The results of these analyses largely disconfirm different current accounts of shifting physician rhetoric around opioids and pain management leading up to the recognition opioid epidemic. Most notably, the results also suggest that biomedical debates surrounding opioids are serving as proxy arguments for shifting primary bioethical obligations from individual patients to public health.}

abstract = {Narrative can be conceptualised as a complex system, with pragmatic benefits for our description of interpretative and affective processes involved in reading. In this article, I show how systemic thinking has shaped many literary theories, and I offer some suggestions about the modelling of narrative as a complex system. Considering the relations between text, reader, and reading situation as constitutive of narrative requires a way of looking at stories keeping in mind that the reader’s experiential background, their cognitive-affective states, and the situational context all play a crucial role in the emergence of what we call a narrative. Here I suggest that Transformer-based language models can be considered artificial systems that simulate a (disembodied) reading process and make it possible to model narrative as a complex system, including the encoded experiential background of the (simulated) reader.}

This two-dimensional (2D) four-stroke SI engine model simulates the combustion of the fuel, heptane, in the engine cylinder based on realistic boundary conditions. The development of the model helps engineering students better understand the combined effects of chemical reactions, species transport, flow patterns and temperature distributions in the SI engine. This model has been applied in a practical session in an undergraduate engineering course since 2012. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first time that CFD engine models are used as a hands-on tool in IC engine courses. Feedback from students is quite positive.}

abstract = {Purpose This article takes a postfoundational lens to reflect upon my ethnographic (re)searching experience in a Hong Kong high school biology classroom to expose ignorant theoretical–methodological assumptions of researchers and teachers on critical thinking for new realizations. Design/Approach/Methods Using an encountered embodied thinking moment as a trigger, this article examines the texts/discourses collected from teachers/teaching and students/learning to unpack underlying philosophical–theoretical–methodological traps and ignorance. Findings The analysis exposes three ignorant assumptions. First is a mind–body dualism that has historically disembodied thinking as an abstract and invisible mind/cognitive activity. Second is a knowledge–skill/thinking divide that upgrades critical thinking as a transferrable higher-order skill above and external to knowledge. Third is a naturalized assumption that didactic instructions in Asian classrooms are not as conducive to thinking cultivation as (Western) student-centered pedagogies. Originality/Value My postfoundational reflections interrogate and expand these philosophical–theoretical–methodological grounds to reconstruct effective thinking curricula and classrooms.}
