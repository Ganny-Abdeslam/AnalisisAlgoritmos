abstract = {Background According to the Committee on STEM Education, K-12 science students need access to learning experiences that promote collaboration and engagement. To fill that void, we need to develop activities that stimulate engaged learning and scaffold effective collaboration. K-12 teacher candidates see value in utilizing games for this purpose. Specifically, tabletop science games can help teachers engage students in science learning and scaffold collaboration. Aim For this study, we designed a collaborative, STEM-themed card game called MOUNTAIN RESCUE and explored its capacity to promote engaged learning and collaboration. Method Four groups of STEM campers (n = 14) in a suburban Mid-Atlantic region played MOUNTAIN RESCUE. All groups had a mix of boys and girls. Play-testers ranged from 10–13 years old. The tabletop game took approximately 30-minutes. During gameplay, players embodied unique STEM roles: physicist, chemist, structural engineer, and electrical engineer. They collaborated to solve challenges related to electricity, physics, chemistry, and engineering design. Discourse was audio-recorded throughout gameplay. Immediately after gameplay, self-report survey data were collected to assess flow and perceptions of collaborative learning. Results Findings demonstrated that the game promoted engagement and collaboration. Specifically, students had a flow-like experience and felt positively about the game’s value for collaborative learning. Utterances demonstrating active engagement and constructive thinking became more group-focused over time. Conclusion This study contributes to science education by demonstrating potential benefits of a well-designed, low-tech, science learning environment or—in other words—a tabletop game.}

abstract = {A call has been made over the last decade for the expansion of epidemiology coursework into high schools in the United States. Epidemiology instruction has been shown to increase student scientific and health literacy, promote critical thinking skills, enhance students’ perception of public health as both practical and relevant, and empower students as independent, lifelong learners. Epidemiology is also a flexible science with relevance to students from diverse backgrounds, skill levels, and interests. While there has been tremendous growth in undergraduate public health education, we have yet to witness the mainstream adoption of epidemiology into high school coursework. In this article, I propose the formal integration of epidemiology into high school curricula to help students practice science as it relates to public health. I posit that epidemiology is a flexible science discipline with real-world significance to students from diverse backgrounds, skill levels, and interests. Also, teaching epidemiology through guided inquiry and authentic learning strategies can intrinsically motivate and empower students to address health-related problems in their local communities. Moreover, epidemiology instruction at the high school level can meet student learning needs, teacher instructional objectives, administrative mandates, and community interests. In essence, epidemiology instruction at the high school level can hone fundamental skills in preparation for health and science careers and promote important public health awareness and interest among adolescents.}

abstract = {This article deals with a new approach to understand the magnetic-field-assisted nano-finishing process in which computational fluid dynamics is used to simulate the forces. A finite element method is used to evaluate the magnetic field intensity, mathematical modelling is applied to model the nano-finishing operation, and the experiments are conducted to compare the experimental results with the simulated results. A flexible polishing tool comprising a magnetorheological polishing medium is used for this process. The relative motion between the polishing medium and the workpiece surface provides the required finishing action. In the present work, a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulation of a magnetorheological polishing medium inside the workpiece fixture is performed to evaluate the axial and radial stresses developed owing to the flow of magnetically stiffened magnetorheological polishing medium. A finite element analysis is performed in order to find out the direction and the magnitude of the magnetic field. A microstructure of the mixture of magnetic and abrasive particles in the magnetorheological polishing medium is proposed in order to calculate forces acting on an active abrasive particle. Modelling of the surface finish is performed after analysing the surface roughness profile data. Further finishing experiments are conducted in order to compare the simulated surface roughness value with the experimental results and they are found to agree well.}

abstract = {Is the relationship between criminal thinking and recidivism the same for criminal justice–involved individuals from varying demographic backgrounds? Relying on two independent samples of offenders and two measures of criminal thinking, the current studies examined whether four demographic factors—gender, race, age, and education—moderated the relationship between criminal thinking and recidivism. Study 1 consisted of 226 drug-involved probationers enrolled in a randomized clinical trial. Study 2 consisted of 346 jail inmates from a longitudinal study. Logistic regression models suggested that the strength of the relationship between criminal thinking and subsequent recidivism did not vary based on participant demographics, regardless of justice system setting or measure of criminal thinking. Criminal thinking predicts recidivism similarly for people who are male, female, Black, White, older, younger, and more or less educated.}

Using a corpus of 1,467 articles and essays published in the New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the American Medical Association between 1959 and May 2019, this study evaluates diachronic shifts in (a) the framing of opioid pharmacology, (b) the relative attention paid to pain management versus opioid dependence risks, and (c) the distribution of statements related to physicians’ primary ethical obligations. The results of these analyses largely disconfirm different current accounts of shifting physician rhetoric around opioids and pain management leading up to the recognition opioid epidemic. Most notably, the results also suggest that biomedical debates surrounding opioids are serving as proxy arguments for shifting primary bioethical obligations from individual patients to public health.}

abstract = {With the current shift of increasing the computational power of a processor by including multiple cores instead of increasing the clock frequency, consideration of computational efficiency is gaining increased importance for computational fluid dynamics codes. This is especially critical for applications that require high throughput. For example, applying computational fluid dynamics simulations to multi-disciplinary design optimization requires a large number of similar simulations with different input parameters. Therefore, a reduction in the runtime of the code can lead to large reduction in the design process. In our case study, a two-dimensional, block-structured computational fluid dynamics code was optimized for performance on machines with hierarchical memory systems. This paper illustrates the techniques applied to transform an initial version of the code to an optimized version that yielded performance improvements of 10% for very small cases to about 50% for large test cases that did not fit into the cache memory of the target processor. A detailed performance analysis of the code starting at the global level down to subroutines and data structures is presented in this paper. The performance improvements can be explained through a reduction of cache misses in all levels of the memory hierarchy. The L1 cache misses were reduced by about 50%, the L2 cache misses by about 80% and the translation lookaside buffer misses by about 90% for the optimized version of the code. The code performance was also evaluated for multi-core processors, where efficiency is especially important when several instances of an application are running simultaneously. In this case, the most optimized version, a blocked version of the optimized code, more effectively maintained efficiency as more cores were activated compared to the unblocked version. This illustrates that optimizing cache performance may be increasingly important as the number of cores per processor continues to rise.}

abstract = {People spend most of their time indoors; therefore, maintaining a good indoor air quality and meeting the requirements of comfort and energy efficiency are essential. One of the most widespread strategies to achieve this objective is improving ventilation efficiency; therefore, the main aim of this study was to show an optimization of the ventilation efficiency, in a specific room, considering 47 variations (case studies) in the furniture arrangement. For this purpose, a numerical analysis using computational fluid dynamics techniques, validated by the tracer gas decay technique, was used to assess the distribution of the age of air within the space. The concept of “age of air” was implemented in the computational fluid dynamics code through user-defined functions, using the steady-state method based on the resolution of a transport equation for an additional scalar. Variations up to 5.75% in the ventilation efficiency between the cases studied have been achieved. It is concluded that an improvement up to 1.65% can be obtained when the elements of the study are introduced in a way that facilitates the air movement towards the exhaust; therefore, improvement of the ventilation efficiency through specific furniture distributions is possible, although not significant, according to the outcomes.}

We find differences between topics in the two periods in each of the journals’ groups and between the two groups themselves. In the European group, we find centrality of topics related to media change and media logic. In the ICA journals, we find a strengthening of scholarly engagement with effects studies.

This two-dimensional (2D) four-stroke SI engine model simulates the combustion of the fuel, heptane, in the engine cylinder based on realistic boundary conditions. The development of the model helps engineering students better understand the combined effects of chemical reactions, species transport, flow patterns and temperature distributions in the SI engine. This model has been applied in a practical session in an undergraduate engineering course since 2012. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first time that CFD engine models are used as a hands-on tool in IC engine courses. Feedback from students is quite positive.}

abstract = {Purpose This article takes a postfoundational lens to reflect upon my ethnographic (re)searching experience in a Hong Kong high school biology classroom to expose ignorant theoretical–methodological assumptions of researchers and teachers on critical thinking for new realizations. Design/Approach/Methods Using an encountered embodied thinking moment as a trigger, this article examines the texts/discourses collected from teachers/teaching and students/learning to unpack underlying philosophical–theoretical–methodological traps and ignorance. Findings The analysis exposes three ignorant assumptions. First is a mind–body dualism that has historically disembodied thinking as an abstract and invisible mind/cognitive activity. Second is a knowledge–skill/thinking divide that upgrades critical thinking as a transferrable higher-order skill above and external to knowledge. Third is a naturalized assumption that didactic instructions in Asian classrooms are not as conducive to thinking cultivation as (Western) student-centered pedagogies. Originality/Value My postfoundational reflections interrogate and expand these philosophical–theoretical–methodological grounds to reconstruct effective thinking curricula and classrooms.}
