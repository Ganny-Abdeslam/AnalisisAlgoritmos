abstract = {We study media representations of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In particular, we train models of semantic memory on a large number of news media outlets that published online articles during the course of the election. Based on the structure of word co-occurrence in these media outlets, our models learn semantic representations for the two presidential candidates as well as for widely studied personality traits. We find that models trained on media outlets most read by Clinton voters and media outlets most read by Trump voters differ in the strength of association between the two candidates’ names and trait words pertaining to morality. We observe some differences for trait words pertaining to warmth, but none for trait words pertaining to competence.}

abstract = {I present here two results from investigations of a computational theory of how the human visual system may obtain information about the physical environment directly from optically sensed velocity fields (optical flow). Previous work has shown how optical flow arises when an observer moves through the static environment. The inverse problem is investigated here: how to recover intrinsic characteristics of the environment from optical flow patterns. The first result is a method for computing the local slant of surfaces relative to the moving observer. The second result is a method for detecting and discriminating among the five types of edges that form the boundaries of surfaces. The results have been formalised as mathematical equations, a physiological model, and a computer program. Properties and predictions resulting from these formal models are discussed with regard to experimental findings in psychophysics.}

abstract = {This study examined the effects of teaching adolescents classified as having educable mental handicaps (EMH) to solve four-column subtraction problems involving regrouping through three different methods: (a) pencil and paper, (b) calculators, and (c) calculators employing a rehearsal strategy using problems containing visual cues. The students classified as EMH (five females and two males) were enrolled in a self-contained special education class in a junior high school. Forty-four eighth-grade general education students were selected from the same school to participate in a preexperimental, noninstructional, peer group assessment. An ABCD, single-case experimental design was used, with multiple probes introduced at staggered intervals. Days per phase ranged from 4 to 10. Two maintenance phases were scheduled, the first immediately after the last instructional phase, and the second 26 days later. The results indicated significant differences in performance favoring calculators over pencil and paper for each student classified as EMH. No difference in performance was found for the sample of general education students across computational modes; however, a split point (cutoff score) was found at 17.5 correct digits per minute with pencil and paper, which predicted a student’s best computational mode. Rehearsal and visual cues significantly influenced correct performance for only one student classified as EMH. Maintenance of correct performance with calculators over time was excellent for each pupil. A positive relationship was found between the number of head swings used to input digits into a calculator and computational time. Without calculators, the students classified as EMH were markedly inferior to their general education peers; however, with calculators the performances were equivalent. Several clinical issues involved in conventional and calculator instruction for students with special needs are discussed.}

abstract = {An aim of human factors research is to have models that allow for the advance design of user-friendly environments. This is still a distant dream because existing models are not yet sufficiently sophisticated. Models in the domain of motor control are a case in point, but recent developments in computational motor control suggest that the gap between the current state of modeling in this area and the desired state is shrinking. To illustrate this point, we review principles of motor control research that any model of motor control must accommodate. Then we describe a model that captures many of the capacities of actors in the everyday world, including the capacity to reach for objects in different ways depending on factors such as the ease with which different joints can rotate, the required speed of movement, and whether obstacles are present. The model relies on the ideas that goal postures are internally specified before movements are generated, that tasks are defined with flexibly ordered constraint hierarchies, and that movements can be shaped according to task demands. Actual or potential applications of this research include designing and testing possible environments where motor components play a key role.}

abstract = {This article is a case-based review that introduces applied statisticians to a number of issues and methods that arise in clinical studies with paired digital images as outcomes. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is the imaging modality used in two examples. The first is a physical simulation of relevant clinical features of SPECT images using a customized head phantom scanned under different experimental conditions. The objective is to demonstrate and compare several current methods for image registration, i.e., image superimposition in some optimal manner to obtain a common frame of reference within which to make pixel-by-pixel comparisons. Image registration together with image normalization to correct for spurious differences in background activity levels enable quantification of differences in paired images. The physical simulation assesses quantification accuracy. The second example involves two SPECT images of the same brain tumour patient taken about two months apart. The objective here is to demonstrate several tools from morphological image analysis for image segmentation, i.e., separation of “figure” and “ground”, and simple image regression to detect patterns of differences in time, again after registration and normalization. The clinical context of both examples helps to keep the review in practical focus and is a useful starting point for descriptions of many standard tools in applied medical image analysis. References to relevant literature are provided for readers wanting to study particular subjects in depth. As medical image analysis becomes more sophisticated, more cost-conscious and scrutinized more intensively, proper attention to the computational and statistical bases for practical conclusions become even more crucial.}

abstract = {An accelerating strategy to the well-known Frank-Wolfe algorithm for solution of the traffic assignment problem (TAP) is presented here. The Frank-Wolfe algorithm has been widely accepted and recognized by transportation researchers and practitioners as a state-of-the-practice solution method for TAP. With abundant numerical examples, the proposed accelerating strategy was compared with other accelerating methods, such as the parallel tangent technique, Fukushima direction, and Weintraub step size. The computational results successfully indicate that this new strategy is capable of obtaining highly accurate solutions with relatively moderate central processing unit time consumed. The computational results also indicate that the performance of this accelerating strategy is better than state-of-the-art algorithms, such as the restricted simplicial decomposition algorithm and the gradient projection algorithm. The proposed accelerating strategy is easy to implement and suitable for obtaining accurate solutions to TAP because of its economical memory requirement and stable performance, even when large and congested networks are considered.}

abstract = {Introduction A radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the best choice for achieving vascular access (VA) for hemodialysis, but this AVF has high rates of early failure due to juxta-anastomotic stenosis, making it impossible to use for dialysis. Low hemodynamic shear stress contributes to the pathophysiology of VA failure due to secondary thrombosis, stenosis, and re-occlusion after percutaneous intervention. Methods We used a computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) approach to evaluate the shear stress distribution and minimize its effects under various conditions including changes in the anastomosis angle. A three-dimensional computational domain was designed for arteriovenous end-to-side anastomosis based on anastomosis angles of 45°, 90° and including 135° angle of an obtuse anastomosis using three-dimensional design software. COMSOL Multiphysics® simulation software was used to identify the hemodynamic factors influencing wall shear stress at the anastomosis site using a low Reynolds number k-ε turbulence model that included non-Newtonian blood flow characteristics, the complete cardiac pulse cycle, and distention of blood vessels. In preliminary clinical study, all 201 patients who received a radiocephalic wrist AVF from January 2009 to February 2014 were divided into classic and obtuse angle groups. Results The CFD results showed that the largest anastomosis angle (135°) resulted in lower shear stress, which would help reduce AVF failures. This obtuse angle was preferred, as it minimized the development of anastomotic stenosis and tended to favor primary and primary-assisted patency in clinical study. Conclusions An obtuse radiocephalic wrist AVF shows more favorable patency compared to a classic radiocephalic AVF. Surgeons establishing a radiocephalic wrist AVF would be better to consider an AVF with an obtuse anastomosis.}

abstract = {A new frequency-domain implementation of a synthetic aperture focusing technique is presented in the paper. The concept is based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and sonar that is a developed version of the convolution model in the frequency domain. Compared with conventional line-by-line imaging, synthetic aperture imaging has a better resolution and contrast at the cost of more computational load. To overcome this problem, point-by-point reconstruction methods have been replaced by block-processing algorithms in radar and sonar; however, these techniques are relatively unknown in medical imaging. In this paper, we extended one of these methods called wavenumber to medical ultrasound imaging using a simple model of synthetic aperture focus. The model, derived here for monostatic mode, can be generalized to multistatic as well. The method consists of 4 steps: a 2D fast Fourier transform of the data, frequency shift of the data to baseband, interpolation to convert polar coordinates to rectangular ones, and returning the data to the spatial-domain using a 2D inverse Fourier transform. We have also used chirp pulse excitation followed by matched filtering and spotlighting algorithm to compensate the effect of differences in parameters between radar and medical imaging. Computational complexities of the two methods, wavenumber and delay-and-sum (DAS), have been calculated. Field II simulated point data have been used to evaluate the results in terms of resolution and contrast. Evaluations with simulated data show that for typical phantoms, reconstruction by the wavenumber algorithm is almost 20 times faster than classical DAS while retaining the resolution.}
