abstract = {This paper proposes a computational approach to sociology. I argue that computational sociology is not just another specialty within an already fragmented discipline but that it provides an opportunity to integrate traditionally disparate approaches within sociology and provides a foundation for transforming sociology in the 2Ist century. I discuss important changes in computing that offer new opportunities for sociology and illustrate those points with examples of ongoing sociological research. The potential advantages of such an approach are identified and some of the characteristics of computational sociology are described. Keywords: sociology, computers, computational sociology, paradigm change, research methodology.}

abstract = {This article argues that agent-based modeling (ABM) is the methodological implication of Lawson’s championed ontological turn in economics. We single out three major properties of agent-based computational economics (ACE), namely, autonomous agents, social interactions, and the micro-macro links, which have been well accepted by the ACE community. We then argue that ACE does make a full commitment to the ontology of economics as proposed by Lawson, based on his prompted critical realism. Nevertheless, the article also points out the current limitations or constraints of ACE. Efforts to overcome them are deemed to be crucial before ACE can make itself more promising to the current ontological turn in economics.}

abstract = {Extracorporeal endotoxin removal by means of the Toraymyxin device is based on the ability of polymyxin B to bind endotoxins with a high specificity. The endotoxins/polymyxin molecular interactions were computationally analyzed in a parallel work (Part I). In this paper we investigate with a multi-scale approach the phenomena involving blood and plasma fluid dynamics inside the device. The macro- and mesoscale phenomena were studied by means of 3D models using computational fluid dynamics. The flow behavior in the sorbent material was focused, modeling the sorbent as a homogeneous porous medium at the macroscale level, or accounting for the realistic geometry of its knitted fibers at the mesoscale level. A microscale model was then developed to analyze the behavior of endotoxin molecules subjected to the competition of flow drag and molecular attraction by fibergrafted polymyxin B. The macroscale results showed that a very regular flow field develops in the sorbent, furthermore supplying the peak velocity to be input in the lower-scale model. The mesoscale analysis yielded the realistic range for wall shear stresses (WSSs) acting on fiber walls. With WSS values in the entire range, the results of the microscale analysis demonstrated that the capability of polymyxin B to capture endotoxin molecules from the flow extends at distances one order of magnitude greater than the characteristic distance of the stable intermolecular bond. We conclude that the use of an integrated, multi-scale analysis allows for a comprehensive understanding of the complex mechanisms involved in endotoxin sorption phenomena with immobilized polymyxin B.}

abstract = {Purpose: To use computational simulations to compare the hemodynamic characteristics of a classic bifurcated stent-graft to an equally long endograft design with “dog bone”–shaped limbs (DB), which have large diameter proximal and distal ends and significant narrowing at the midsection to accommodate aneurysms with an extremely narrow bifurcation. Materials and Methods: A 3-dimensional model was constructed using commercially available validated software. Inlet and outlet diameters were 28 and 14 mm, respectively. The total length of both models was kept constant to 180 mm, but the main body of the DB model was 20 mm shorter than the bifurcated endograft. The iliac limbs of the DB model had a 9-mm stenosis over a 30-mm segmental length in the midsection. Flow was quantified by time-averaged wall shear stress, oscillatory shear index (OSI), and relative residence time (RRT). The displacement forces in newtons (N) and maximum wall shear stress (WSS) in pascals (Pa) were compared during a cardiac cycle at 3 segments (main body, bifurcation, and iliac limbs) of both models with computational fluid dynamics analysis. Results: The DB accommodation was associated with higher forces at the main body (range 3.15–4.9 Ν) compared with the classic configuration (1.56–2.34 N). On the contrary, the forces at the bifurcation (3.81–5.98 vs 3.76–5.54 N) and at the iliac limbs (0.34–0.85 vs 0.49–0.74 N) were comparable for both models. Accordingly, maximum WSS was detected at the iliac sites for both models throughout the cardiac cycle. The highest values were detected at peak systole and equaled 26.6 and 12 Pa for the DB and bifurcated configurations, respectively. The narrow segments in the DB model displayed high stress values but low OSI and very low RRT. Conclusion: The DB accommodation seems to correlate with higher displacement forces at the main body and higher stresses at the iliac limbs. Consequently, regular imaging follow-up of the DB design deems necessary to delineate its mid- and long-term clinical performance.}

abstract = {A widely advocated idea in education is that people learn better when the flow of experience is under their control (i.e., learning is self-directed). However, the reasons why volitional control might result in superior acquisition and the limits to such advantages remain poorly understood. In this article, we review the issue from both a cognitive and computational perspective. On the cognitive side, self-directed learning allows individuals to focus effort on useful information they do not yet possess, can expose information that is inaccessible via passive observation, and may enhance the encoding and retention of materials. On the computational side, the development of efficient “active learning” algorithms that can select their own training data is an emerging research topic in machine learning. This review argues that recent advances in these related fields may offer a fresh theoretical perspective on how people gather information to support their own learning.}

abstract = {Saint Louis encephalitis virus, a member of the flaviviridae subgroup, is a culex mosquito-borne pathogen. Despite severe epidemic outbreaks on several occasions, not much progress has been made with regard to an epitope-based vaccine designed for Saint Louis encephalitis virus. The envelope proteins were collected from a protein database and analyzed with an in silico tool to identify the most immunogenic protein. The protein was then verified through several parameters to predict the T-cell and B-cell epitopes. Both T-cell and B-cell immunity were assessed to determine that the protein can induce humoral as well as cell-mediated immunity. The peptide sequence from 330–336 amino acids and the sequence REYCYEATL from the position 57 were found as the most potential B-cell and T-cell epitopes, respectively. Furthermore, as an RNA virus, one important thing was to establish the epitope as a conserved one; this was also done by in silico tools, showing 63.51% conservancy. The epitope was further tested for binding against the HLA molecule by computational docking techniques to verify the binding cleft epitope interaction. However, this is a preliminary study of designing an epitope-based peptide vaccine against Saint Louis encephalitis virus; the results awaits validation by in vitro and in vivo experiments.}

abstract = {Partly presented in Interdisciplinary Transport Phenomena VII, Dresden, Germany, 19–23 September 2011.Compression moulding experiments of sheet moulding compound, visual observations of a vacuum test with prepregs and numerical models with two main approaches for computational fluid dynamics simulations of the mould filling phase are presented. One assumes that there are layers near the mould surfaces with much less viscosity and the other only use one viscosity model. The numerical experiments showed that the pressure could be accurately predicted with both approaches. The property necessary to predict correct pressure with altered mould closing velocities was that the bulk material had to obey shear-thinning effects. Preheating effects before compression were neglected, but altering the heating time until the prepreg was assumed to start flow had a significant effect. The experiments confirmed that the pressure is predominantly affected by the mould closing velocity. Regardless of the considered process settings, a first pressure top always appeared approximately at the logarithmic strain 0.25. A second top was associated with a slowdown of the press. The location of this was affected by the velocity and the vacuum, the latter indicating that vacuum assistance prevents a build-up of back pressure. Furthermore, heated prepreg above a critical temperature is observed to swell immediately as vacuum assistance is applied.}

abstract = {Background and purpose: Computational fluid dynamics method (CFDM) and optical flow method (OFM) effectively provide the hemodynamic information based on the digital subtraction angiogram (DSA). However, the quantitative analysis in comparison of CFDM and OFM is still absent. The goal of this study is to apply CFDM and OFM in quantitative analysis of stenting treatment. Material and method: A left carotid stenosis patient underwent stenting of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was analyzed as an example. CFDM and OFM for hemodynamic analysis on digital subtraction angiography before and after stenting treatment were presented. Results: Improvement gains of blood flow velocities on left internal carotid artery after stenting treament for different initial conditions on the common carotid artery were 1.91 ∼ 2.13, 1.62 ∼ 2.09, and 0.69 by CFDM with Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids and OFM, respectively. With the CFDM analysis, the flow mapping by OFM using time resolved DSA data on the fly to estimate hemodynamic significance of a cervical carotid stenosis was explained. Conclusion: Quantificative blood flow estimations by CFDM and OFM to evaluate the treatment outcomes to patient with carotid stenosis are practical. Both methods are able to provide quantitative information of blood flow for stenting treatment. It is advantagious to use both methods in treatment evaluation.}

A very detailed computational analysis based on finite element modes is developed representing the load-carrying box girder of the blade with a given airfoil shape, size, and the type and position of the interior load-bearing longitudinal beams–shear webs. Results concerning displacements and stresses are generated using both plane and shell elements with linear and nonlinear analyses.}

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the most important superfamily of protein targets in current ligand discovery and drug development. GPCRs are integral membrane proteins that play key roles in various cellular signaling processes. Therefore, GPCR signaling pathways are closely associated with numerous diseases, including cancer and several neurological, immunological, and hematological disorders. Computer-aided drug design (CADD) can expedite the process of GPCR drug discovery and potentially reduce the actual cost of research and development. Increasing knowledge of biological structures, as well as improvements on computer power and algorithms, have led to unprecedented use of CADD for the discovery of novel GPCR modulators. Similarly, machine learning approaches are now widely applied in various fields of drug target research. This review briefly summarizes the application of rising CADD methodologies, as well as novel machine learning techniques, in GPCR structural studies and bioligand discovery in the past few years. Recent novel computational strategies and feasible workflows are updated, and representative cases addressing challenging issues on olfactory receptors, biased agonism, and drug-induced cardiotoxic effects are highlighted to provide insights into future GPCR drug discovery.}
