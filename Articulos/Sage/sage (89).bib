abstract = {The political landscape in Bangladesh is complex and multifaceted, with limited exploration in relation to the rapidly growing news industry. This study aims to address this gap by analyzing 15,801 news articles, utilizing trend analysis and topic modeling. The findings reveal a consistent decline in political news coverage, with sporadic increases during parliamentary election years. The dominant focus of news topics revolves around the two major political parties, the Awami League (AL) and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), indicating the country’s two-party-centric nature of politics. Smaller political parties receive media coverage primarily when they form coalitions with major parties, further highlighting the dominance of the two major parties in political news coverage. The study also uncovers a preference for individual political figures over incidents or events in news coverage, suggesting a patron-client relationship within major political parties and a hierarchical decision-making system. In addition, the study identifies shifts in news framing during significant events, such as national elections, indicating changes in person-centric news frames, but always involving one of the two major political parties. Finally, the study highlights and raises important questions about potential political control over media and journalistic activities, stimulating discourse on journalistic freedom and political free speech.}

abstract = {Abstract An overview over flamelet modelling for turbulent non-premixed combustion is given. A short review of previous contributions to simulations of direct injection (DI) diesel engine combustion using the representative interactive flamelet concept is presented. A surrogate fuel consisting of 70 per cent (liquid volume) n-decane and 30 per cent α-methyl-naphthalene is experimentally compared to real diesel fuel. The resemblance of their physical and chemical properties is shown to result in very similar combustion and pollutant formation for both fuels. In order to account for variations of the scalar dissipation rate within the computational domain, a method using multiple flamelets, called the Eulerian particle flamelet model, is used. A strategy is described for subdividing the computational domain and assigning the resulting subdomains to different flamelet histories represented by Eulerian marker particles. Experiments conducted with an Audi DI diesel engine and diesel fuel are compared to simulations using the surrogate fuel. The use of multiple flamelets, each having a different history, significantly improves the description of the ignition phase, leading to a better prediction of pressure, heat release and exhaust emissions of soot and NOx. The effect of the number of flamelet particles on the predictions is discussed.}

abstract = {Motivated by the change of effective electrical properties grain or phase boundaries, a computational multiscale framework for continua with interfaces at the microscale is proposed. Cohesive-type interfaces are considered at the microscale, such that displacement and electrical potential jumps are accounted for. The governing equations for materials with interfaces under mechanical and electrical loads are provided. Based on these, a computational multiscale formulation is proposed. The coupling between the electrical and mechanical subproblem is established by the constitutive equations at the material interface. In order to investigate deformation-induced property changes at the microscale, the evolution of interface damage is elaborated. The proposed multiscale framework is further examined through various representative boundary value problems so as to identify its key properties.}

abstract = {In the current review, an exceptional view on the multi-scale integrated computational modelling and data-driven methods in the Additive manufacturing (AM) of metallic materials in the framework of integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) is discussed. In the first part of the review, process simulation (P-S linkage), structure modelling (S-P linkage), property simulation (S-P linkage), and integrated modelling (PSP and PSPP linkages) are elaborated considering different physical phenomena (multi-physics) in AM and at micro/meso/macro scales (multi-scale modelling). The second part provides an extensive discussion of a data-driven framework, which involves extracting existing data from databases and texts, data pre-processing, high throughput screening, and, therefore, database construction. A data-driven workflow that integrates statistical methods, including ML, artificial intelligence (AI), and neural network (NN) models, has great potential for completing PSPP linkages. This review paper provides an insight for both academic and industrial researchers, working on the AM of metallic materials.}

abstract = {The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly influencing our education system. It is apparent that the students of today are mostly attached with their smart mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and various other forms of advanced technologies for their quality of learning. It has become an urgent necessity for school students to become future AI ready. Understanding the wide potential impact of AI, India has started initiatives to prepare young learners for future AI ready. Central Board of Secondary Education in the direction of National Education Policy (2020) introduces two-fold AI in its affiliated school curricula. Using a systematic review technique, the present study has attempted to explore the promise and potentiality of AI in school education, and provide a comprehensive overview of the current status and development trends of AI in school, the initiatives, planning, strategies, and steps taken by India and other countries regarding AI integration in their school system. Finally, the study brings out some concluding remarks towards innovative AI integration.}

abstract = {One advantage of highly automated vehicles is drivers can use commute time for non-driving tasks, such as work-related tasks. The potential for an auto-mobile office—a space where drivers work in automated vehicles—is a complex yet underexplored idea. This paper begins to define a design space of the auto- mobile office in SAE Level 3 automated vehicles by integrating the affinity diagram (AD) with a computational representation of the abstraction hierarchy (AH). The AD uses a bottom-up approach where researchers starting with individual findings aggregate and abstract those into higher-level concepts. The AH uses a top-down approach where researchers start with first principles to identify means-ends links between system goals and concrete forms of the system. Using the programming language R, the means-ends links of AH can be explored statistically. This computational approach to the AH provides a systematic means to define the design space of the auto-mobile office.}

abstract = {Piaget has distinguished a number of distinct stages in the development of the concept of an enduring external object during infancy. I present a theory of a class of behaviours at one of these stages embodied in a working computer program. The behaviour of this program matches a class of perceptual behaviours of infants between about twelve and twenty weeks of age in a number of experimental situations studied by Bower. The theory argues that these behaviours are a result of the interaction between the perceptual and conceptual levels of the system, and the way in which conflicts between competing descriptions of an object are resolved. I locate the cause of several features of the behaviours in the procedures for managing the changing representation of the world, and the system’s way of treating transitions between the states of an object (for example, moving to stationary). The basic conceptual primitives of the analysis are objects and events, not motion and place, as argued by Bower, or the infant’s previous activity, as argued by Piaget. I argue that adequate explanations of experimental findings such as these require the construction of fairly detailed computational models.}
