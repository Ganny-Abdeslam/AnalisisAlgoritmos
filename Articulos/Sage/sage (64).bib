abstract = {Abstract The development of physically representative models that allow reliable simulation of the processes under realistic conditions is essential for the development and optimization of fuel cells, the introduction of cheaper materials and fabrication techniques, and the design and development of novel architectures. A three-dimensional, multi-phase, non-isothermal computational fluid dynamics model of a novel, simple to construct, tubular, proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell which works in still or slowly moving air has been developed. The novel tubular geometry enables optimum air access to the cathode without the need for pumps, fans, or similar devices. This comprehensive model accounts for the major transport phenomena such as convective and diffusive heat and mass transfer, electrode kinetics, transport and phase-change mechanism of water, and potential fields in a tubular-shaped air-breathing PEM fuel cell. The model explains many interacting, complex electrochemical, and transport phenomena that cannot be studied experimentally. Three-dimensional results of the species profiles, temperature distribution, potential distribution, and local current density distribution are presented and analysed, with the focus on the physical insight and fundamental understanding. These results provide a solid basis for optimizing the geometry of the PEM fuel cell stack running in a passive mode.}

abstract = {Metamodels can be used to reduce the computational burden associated with computationally demanding analyses of simulation models, although applications within health economics are still scarce. Besides a lack of awareness of their potential within health economics, the absence of guidance on the conceivably complex and time-consuming process of developing and validating metamodels may contribute to their limited uptake. To address these issues, this article introduces metamodeling to the wider health economic audience and presents a process for applying metamodeling in this context, including suitable methods and directions for their selection and use. General (i.e., non–health economic specific) metamodeling literature, clinical prediction modeling literature, and a previously published literature review were exploited to consolidate a process and to identify candidate metamodeling methods. Methods were considered applicable to health economics if they are able to account for mixed (i.e., continuous and discrete) input parameters and continuous outcomes. Six steps were identified as relevant for applying metamodeling methods within health economics: 1) the identification of a suitable metamodeling technique, 2) simulation of data sets according to a design of experiments, 3) fitting of the metamodel, 4) assessment of metamodel performance, 5) conducting the required analysis using the metamodel, and 6) verification of the results. Different methods are discussed to support each step, including their characteristics, directions for use, key references, and relevant R and Python packages. To address challenges regarding metamodeling methods selection, a first guide was developed toward using metamodels to reduce the computational burden of analyses of health economic models. This guidance may increase applications of metamodeling in health economics, enabling increased use of state-of-the-art analyses (e.g., value of information analysis) with computationally burdensome simulation models.}

abstract = {In associative models of simple conditioning, conductive connections (associations, Hebbian synapses) are strengthened by the repetitive temporal pairing of stimuli. The associations cause the animal to behave more adaptively, but they do not encode information about objectively specifiable properties of the conditioning experience. In information processing (computational) models, the temporal intervals in that experience are timed and the results recorded in memory for later use in computations that determine the decisions whether and when to respond to the conditioned stimulus. The predictions of these latter models depend on the ratios of remembered and currently experienced temporal intervals; hence, they are time-scale invariant. Two examples of empirical time-scale invariance are described: Neither the delay of reinforcement nor the ratio of reinforced to unreinforced presentations of the conditioned stimulus affects rates of acquisition and extinction. Time-scale invariance has far-reaching implications for models of the processes that underlie conditioning, for example, models of Hebbian synapses.}

After cautioning against overselling the capabilities of CFD codes, a review is presented of the more significant computational work undertaken in this field. Three recent applications of CFD are examined: (a) a high-speed rail vehicle in a cross-wind; (b) cross-flow impingement on a freight vehicle in the Channel Tunnel; (c) the temperature environment in a stationary passenger train. Comparative experimental data are offered for each of the above. An analysis of these applications is used to derive a promising strategy for the practical application of CFD.}

abstract = {Cylindrical gas film sealing technology is a new type of dry gas sealing technology. Compared with the face gas film sealing technology, the cylindrical gas film seal presents a strong floating property, which can reduce the vibration and thermal deformation of the rotor system. In this article, the effect of operating parameters such as speed, pressure difference and viscosity on the T-groove gas cylindrical film seal performance are studied in detail by the method of control variable in computational fluid dynamics software, and pressure distribution, gas film stiffness, leakage, leakage stiffness ratio and hydrodynamic force are analysed. Results show that with the increase of the rotational speed, static pressure, hydrodynamic force and film stiffness increase, but leakage decreases first and then increases. Furthermore, the results indicate that with the increase of pressure difference, the static pressure, leakage and hydrodynamic force increase. In addition, the simulations show that when the viscosity increases, the maximum pressure and film stiffness increase, but the leakage decreases. This indicates that as the rotational speed increases, the hydrodynamic effect and the amount of gas overflow in the axial direction increase, resulting in an increase of leakage. Lastly, the results also show that when the pressure difference increases, both the radial and axial gas flow rates increase, resulting in an increase in both the film stiffness and the leakage. With the increase of viscosity, the viscous shear force and fluid hydrodynamic force increase, resulting in the increase of the gas film stiffness. This study can provide a theoretical basis in industrial applications for setting the operating parameters and serving as a reference.}

abstract = {A method for computational description of morphology of dispersive components’ spatial structures in composites has been developed. The method is based on the calculation and comparison average values of the elongation coefficient (Ke), sinuosity coefficient (Ks), and fullness coefficient (Kf) for structures of the dispersed phase. Stationary systems such as composite oligodiene epoxide vulcanizate (PDI 3AK) as matrix with micro-dispersive aluminium powder and composite methyl methacrylate-styrene (PMMAS) as matrix with magnetite Fe3O4 nanoparticles were investigated by SEM and AFM, respectively. Time behavior of micro-dispersive carbon black in dynamic system comprised of polydivinylisoprene oligomer (PDI) as the matrix was studied by optical microscopy. The obtained results by method for computational description of morphology had showed universality of the method and enabled ascertaining quantitative correlations describing shapes of certain particles of the filler and morphology of spatial structure under formation. Dependence of form coefficients on the time was determined. This dependence enables studying kinetics of structure formation.}

abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling (or field modeling) is becoming the main method for numerical simulation of building fires. Among many factors that influence the validity and accuracy of CFD simulation results, the computational domain is sometimes overlooked. In this article, the effects of computational domain on simulation results are analyzed. Simulation results from the use of different domains are compared with experimental data reported in the literature. A parametric study is then conducted to reveal a relationship between the effective domain extension and the heat release rate of the enclosure fire. The effect of computational domain extension in relation to vent opening is also investigated. It is found that the selection of computational domain can have a significant effect on the outcome of enclosure fire simulations. Determination of the appropriate computational domain without unduly sacrificing computational efficiency is also discussed.}

abstract = {Robotics Education (RE) is viewed as a tool to narrow the gender gap in STEM fields, especially for promoting girls’ learning. As an emerging and potential model in RE, Pair Learning (PL) is different from Individual Learning (IL), which is impacted by many factors. Among them, social factors need to be further explored. Therefore, this study emphasized gender as a key social factor and focused on girls’ learning performance in different learning models (IL and PL) and gender pairing patterns (boy-girl and girl-girl), as well as exploring the effective pedagogy for enhancing girls’ learning performance in RE. To this end, we conducted a comparison experiment in two classes from the fifth grade in a Chinese primary school. Results indicated that: (a) PL outperforms IL in enhancing girls’ learning engagement; (b) PL and IL have the same effect on the girls’ learning attitude and robotics works; (c) Mixed-gender pairing is more beneficial for girls to complete robotics works than single-gender pairing; and (d) Mixed-gender pairing and single-gender pairing have the same effects on girls’ learning attitudes and engagement. The key findings, possible reasons, and implications for practice are also discussed.}
