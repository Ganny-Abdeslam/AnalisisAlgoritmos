abstract = {This paper reports on comparing results on the fire environment predicted by using the technique of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) (or field modelling) on simulating an enclosure fire at the preflashover stage with those results reported experimentally in the literature. The theory behind this is to solve a system of partial differential equations describing conservation of mass, momentum and heat with the k-ε turbulence model. The computer pro gram PHOENICS is used as the simulation tool. By specifying the geometrical configurations of the enclosure and the location, size and thermal power of the fire source, it is possible to predict the fire-induced flow and temperature fields. The package can be executed in an IBM personal computer at or above 486 level. Experiments reported by Steckler et al. at the National Bureau of Stan dards, U.S.A. on a single fire chamber; Nakaya et al. at the Building Research Institute, Japan on a double room fire chamber; the corner fire plume by Tran and Janssens; the two-room fire experiment reported by Hagglund at the Na tional Defence Research Establishment (abbreviation: FOA), Sweden; and in the full-scale burning hall by Ingason and Olsson at the Swedish National Test ing and Research Institute (abbreviation: SP), Sweden are considered. Some of the results on the temperature and interface height of the smoke layer are com pared with the popular fire zone model CFAST.}

abstract = {Abstract The development of intimal hyperplasia at arterial bypass graft anastomoses is a major factor responsible for graft failure. A revised surgical technique, involving the incorporation of a small section of vein (vein cuff) into the distal anastomosis of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts, alters the distribution of intimal hyperplasia and improves graft performance. Numerical and in vitro flow visualization experiments have been conducted to identify the flow behaviour in the cuffed bypass model and to determine whether the improved performance of the cuffed system can be accounted for by haemodynamic factors. The flowfield at the cuffed anastomosis is characterized by an expansive recirculation. Separation occurs at the graft heel, and at the cuff toe as the blood enters the recipient artery. Wall shear stresses in the vicinity of the cuff heel are low, but high shear stresses and large spatial gradients in the shearing force act for a time on the artery floor. In the conventional model, a less disturbed flow prevails while the gradients of shear stress on the floor are smaller. Aspects of the anastomotic haemodynamics are worsened when the cuff is employed. The superior patency rates of cuffed bypasses may not be explained purely on the basis of local haemodynamic factors.}

abstract = {In this paper a systematic introduction to computational neural network models is given in order to help spatial analysts learn about this exciting new field. The power of computational neural networks viz-à-viz conventional modelling is illustrated for an application field with noisy data of limited record length: spatial interaction modelling of telecommunication data in Austria. The computational appeal of neural networks for solving some fundamental spatial analysis problems is summarized and a definition of computational neural network models in mathematical terms is given. Three definitional components of a computational neural network—properties of the processing elements, network topology and learning—are discussed and a taxonomy of computational neural networks is presented, breaking neural networks down according to the topology and type of interconnections and the learning paradigm adopted. The attractiveness of computational neural network models compared with the conventional modelling approach of the gravity type for spatial interaction modelling is illustrated before some conclusions and an outlook are given.}

abstract = {Approaches to modeling social phenomena vary on a continuum from simple models, in which causality is clear and parameters few, to realistic, high-fidelity models designed to capture the most detailed system behavior possible in a specific setting. Anthropologists have produced both simple and high-fidelity models. The focus of this article is on high-fidelity modeling in anthropology and the special challenge its complexity presents for model comparison. Useful model comparison requires docking, or rendering models comparable, and the author presents a framework for docking based on the work of Axelrod, and Cioffi-Revilla and Gotts. Docking not only renders models more comparable, allowing for more traditional theory testing, but it also sharpens the discussion about the ontology of anthropological phenomena and how they are best represented as theories and models.}

abstract = {This paper presents a nascent conceptual framework (The LISI4C framework) for designing a Library and Information Science (LIS) curriculum tailored to meet the demands of Industry 4.0 (4IR) in particularly South Africa, with global applicability. The framework is developed through an extensive literature review, drawing from a diverse range of sources. It integrates technical proficiencies, soft skills, adaptability, a global perspective, stakeholder collaboration, experiential learning, predictive skills, and a commitment to continuous curriculum updates to create a holistic educational model. The conceptual framework places technical skills at its core, and expertise in emerging technologies. Soft skills such as critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration, are integrated to foster a well-rounded skill set. A transdisciplinary approach encourages exploration beyond traditional LIS boundaries. The LISI4C framework also underscores the importance of sense-making, adaptability, and a global perspective in preparing graduates for the dynamic 4IR landscape. This paper contributes to the LIS education field by offering a forward-looking LISI4C framework that aligns LIS curriculum with the requirements of 4IR. The framework draws upon key elements, including technical proficiencies, soft skills, adaptability, a global perspective, stakeholder collaboration, experiential learning, predictive skills, and continuous curriculum updates, to create a holistic and forward-looking educational model.}

abstract = {In this paper, a computational fluid dynamics trimming method is proposed and compared with wind tunnel experiment and the blade element method. The NASA’s generic ROBIN helicopter model is adopted for transient simulations to obtain the final main rotor trimming conditions. Totally three steps were applied to the computational fluid dynamics method. The first step is associated with no cyclic pitch motion, the second is regarding pure longitudinal cyclic pitch motion and the last is concerning with pure lateral cyclic pitch motion. At the same time, a simple linear equation system between the roll and pitching moment was established to get the final longitudinal and lateral cyclic pitch angles for the main rotor through the above three steps. An overset grid approach was used where the volume around each blade was modeled in an individual overset grid region. The rotor rotation was resolved with three degrees per time-step. Turbulence was modeled with the well-known SST K-omega model with second-order convection. The helicopter was in straight forward flight with an advance ratio of . Three sources of stick angles, which are also called rotor trimming angles, were shown and compared with each other. And the corresponding results were also plotted with a type of history plot in the computational fluid dynamics condition. In the simulations, the results became quasi periodic after about 1.5 rotations and four rotor rotations were simulated for each case. The pitch moment coefficient and roll moment coefficient were all trimmed to about zero by the computational fluid dynamics trimming method while moments were not removed thoroughly in the other two source conditions.}

abstract = {Design modification is a main step in developing machines and artificial organ. A new dialysis apparatus air chamber detects clot formation and interruption of blood refining circuit. Due to using enough anticoagulant, thrombosis may occur because of vortex formed by turbulent flow. Turbulent blood flow causes to endothelial injury thus supporting the formation of a thrombus. Computational fluid dynamics can estimate the flow velocity and turbulence distribution and it can be used as applicable tool to design diagnosis and modifying. In this paper CFD simulation used to find the high turbulent intensity region within the chamber and an optimization method is adopted based on the geometry changing and trying the simulation results. The turbulent intensity is chosen as a criterion to achieving to an optimized condition. Finally, a best geometry is derived for the chamber entrance by this process and modified prototype is manufactured. This refined chamber maintains on the dialysis machine and tested for several patients with different blood characteristics. The results show that no more clot formation has been observed in this new designed chamber.}

abstract = {Film cooling effectiveness has been studied by using a computational approach based on solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. A wind tunnel test configuration is considered with a total of four cooling hole geometries as a cylindrical hole, a cylindrical hole with an upstream wedge (called ‘ramp’ thereafter), a shaped diffuser, and a double console slot. In all cases, the hole centreline has an inclination angle of 35° against the mainstream airflow and the blowing ratio is unity. Choosing the cylindrical model as a baseline, simulations have been carried out for grid convergence and turbulence model influence studies. Results are compared with available experimental data and other numerical predictions and good agreement has been achieved. Further computations continue with three remaining geometries, using the baseline flow conditions and configuration. Comparing to the results from the baseline model, it was found that the centreline adiabatic cooling effectiveness has shown incremental increases for the ‘ramp’ model, while results from the console slot model and the shape diffuser model have exhibited significant improvements by a factor of 1.5 and 2, respectively. The reason for such a step change in cooling effectiveness is mainly due to the weakening of the vortex structures in the vicinity of the hole exit, thus significantly reducing the entrainment of surrounding ‘hot’ fluids.}
