abstract = {Genetic variations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can cause susceptibility to cancer. Although thousands of genetic variants have been identified to be associated with different cancers, the molecular mechanisms of cancer remain unknown. There is not a particular dataset of relationships between cancer and SNPs, as a bipartite network, for computational analysis and prediction. Link prediction as a computational graph analysis method can help us to gain new insight into the network. In this article, after creating a network between cancer and SNPs using SNPedia and Cancer Research UK databases, we evaluated the computational link prediction methods to foresee new SNP-Cancer relationships. Results show that among the popular scoring methods based on network topology, for relation prediction, the preferential attachment (PA) algorithm is the most robust method according to computational and experimental evidence, and some of its computational predictions are corroborated in recent publications. According to the PA predictions, rs1801394-Non-small cell lung cancer, rs4880-Non-small cell lung cancer, and rs1805794-Colorectal cancer are some of the best probable SNP-Cancer associations that have not yet been mentioned in any published article, and they are the most probable candidates for additional laboratory and validation studies. Also, it is feasible to improve the predicting algorithms to produce new predictions in the future.}

abstract = {In this study, a computational model is developed using finite-element techniques within a continuum micromechanics framework to capture the effect of electron-hopping-induced conductive paths at the nanoscale which contribute to the macroscale piezoresistive response of the nanocomposite. This is achieved by tracking the position of the nanotubes under applied deformations and modifying the conductivity of the intertube region depending on the relative proximity of individual pairs of nanotubes. The formation and disruption of the electron-hopping pathways are highly dependent on intertube distances and under deformations can result in microstructural rearrangements in terms of electrostatic properties leading to transitions in material symmetries and component magnitudes of the effective electrostatic properties. Thus, in order to capture the complexities of changing inhomogeneous nanoscale electrostatic behavior, where analytical Eshelby’s approaches cannot be used, a computational micromechanics model is needed. The effective conductivity and piezoresistive strain tensor coefficients are evaluated using volume-averaged energy equivalencies for aligned CNT–polymer nanocomposites in the transverse direction exploring different volume fractions of CNTs in the polymer and the maximum electron-hopping range. The impact of the electron-hopping mechanism on the effective piezoresistive response is studied through the macroscale effective gauge factors under different loading conditions. The effective piezoresistive strain coefficients and macroscale effective gauge factors are observed to be nonlinear with applied macroscale strain and are highly dependent on the type of boundary conditions. The effective macroscale gauge factors observed in the current study have magnitudes comparable to experimental observations reported in the literature with higher gauge factors observed closer to the percolation threshold.}

abstract = {Our work with the Argus Prime (Schoelles & Gray, 2001) simulated task environment has uncovered a variety of strategies that subjects use, at least sometimes, during target acquisition. However, it is difficult to determine how well subjects implement these strategies and, if implemented, how much these strategies contribute to overall performance. Recently, we have adopted Byrne and Kirlik’s (2002) cognitive-ecological approach to determine what strategies work best in different task environments. In the work reported here, we took one computational cognitive model and, holding all else constant, swapped in and out alternative strategies for target acquisition. We then ran each of these simulated human users ten times through each of four interface conditions.}

abstract = {Despite the evolution of ventricular assist devices, ventricular assist device patients still suffer from complications due to the damage to blood by fluid dynamic stress. Since rotary ventricular assist devices are assumed to exert mainly shear stress, studies of blood damage are based on shear flow experiments. However, measurements and simulations of cell and protein deformation show normal and shear stresses deform, and potentially damage, cells and proteins differently. The aim was to use computational fluid dynamics to assess the prevalence of normal stress, in comparison with shear stress, in rotary ventricular assist devices. Our calculations showed normal stresses do occur in rotary ventricular assist devices: the fluid volumes experiencing normal stress above 10 Pa were 0.011 mL (0.092%) and 0.027 mL (0.39%) for the HeartWare HVAD and HeartMate II (HMII), and normal stresses over 100 Pa were present. However, the shear stress volumes were up to two orders of magnitude larger than the normal stress volumes. Considering thresholds for red blood cell and von Willebrand factor deformation by normal and shear stresses, the fluid volumes causing deformation by normal stress were between 2.5 and 5 times the size of those causing deformation by shear stress. The exposure times to the individual normal stress deformation regions were around 1 ms. The results clearly show, for the first time, that while blood within rotary ventricular assist devices experiences more shear stress at much higher magnitudes as compared with normal stress, there is sufficient normal stress exposure present to cause deformation of, and potentially damage to, the blood components. This study is the first to quantify the fluid stress components in real blood contacting devices.}

abstract = {In this study, a computational fluid dynamics analysis was performed on bio-inspired micro aerial vehicle scale rigid flapping wings. The computational fluid dynamics analysis used a compressible unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes solver with low-Mach number preconditioning to study the complex, highly vortical, three-dimensional flow of low aspect ratio flapping wings at micro aerial vehicle-scale Reynolds numbers. The wing was flapped at a constant 5 Hz flap frequency at a mean chord reference Reynolds number of 25,000. The flapping and pitching kinematics were set to match those of a previous experimental study resulting in a constant flap stroke of 107° at translational pitching angles of 40°, 50°, and 60°. The force and flowfield measurements of the previous flapping-wing experiment were used for the validation of the 3D computational fluid dynamics model. The objectives of this effort were to understand the unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms and their relation to force production and aerodynamic efficiency on a rigid wing undergoing an insect-type flapping motion with passive pitching kinematics. Overall, the computational fluid dynamics results showed good agreement with the measured experimental force data. Additionally, the computational fluid dynamics simulation was able to adequately predict the process of leading edge vortex formation and shedding observed during experimentation. A vorticity summation approach used to calculate the strength of the leading edge vortex from the experimental measurements and from the computational fluid dynamics predicted flowfields showed comparable results. The computational fluid dynamics results were utilized to further analyze the differences in the flowfield and leading edge vortex formation for the three pitch angles tested as well as the instantaneous aerodynamic loads and aerodynamic power.}

The successful development of these simulations is aided by attention to sound software project management and software engineering. We have developed “lessons learned” from a set of code projects that the Department of Energy National Nuclear Security Agency has sponsored to develop nuclear weapons simulations over the last 50 years. We find that some, but not all, of the software project management and development practices (rather than processes) commonly employed for non-technical software add value to the development of scientific software and we identify those that we judge add value. Another key finding, consistent with general software industry experience, is that the optimal project schedule and resource level are solely determined by the requirements once the requirements are fixed.}

Method With the use of computational fluid mechanics software we simulated blood flow in 3 D models of the internal jugular veins that exhibited different morphologies, including nozzle-like strictures in their upper parts and valves in the lower parts. Results In a majority of models with nozzle-like strictures, especially those positioned asymmetrically, abnormal flow pattern was revealed, with significant flow separation and regions with reversed flow. Abnormal valves had no significant impact on flow in a case of already altered flow evoked by stricture in upper part of the vein. Conclusions In our jugular model, cranially-located stenoses, which in clinical practice are primarily caused by external compression, cause more significant outflow impact respect to endoluminal defects and pathological valves located more caudally.}

abstract = {Climate change has the potential to displace large populations in many parts of the developed and developing world. Understanding why, how, and when environmental migrants decide to move is critical to successful strategic planning within organizations tasked with helping the affected groups, and mitigating their systemic impacts. One way to support planning is through the employment of computational modeling techniques. Models can provide a window into possible futures, allowing planners and decision makers to test different scenarios in order to understand what might happen. While modeling is a powerful tool, it presents both opportunities and challenges. This paper builds a foundation for the broader community of model consumers and developers by: providing an overview of pertinent climate-induced migration research, describing some different types of models and how to select the most relevant one(s), highlighting three perspectives on obtaining data to use in said model(s), and the consequences associated with each. It concludes with two case studies based on recent research that illustrate what can happen when ambitious modeling efforts are undertaken without sufficient planning, oversight, and interdisciplinary collaboration. We hope that the broader community can learn from our experiences and apply this knowledge to their own modeling research efforts.}

abstract = {The aim of this study is to investigate the use of computational fluid dynamics in predicting the performance and geometry of the optimal design of a steam ejector used in a steam turbine. Many scholars have analysed the steam ejector using the ideal gas model, which lacks accuracy in terms of calculating the flow field of the ejector. This study is reported in a series of two papers. The first part covers the validation of CFX 11.0 results using different equations of state (EOS) on the converging–diverging nozzle flow field carried out with the experimental value. The IAPWS IF97 real gas model works well with the experimental value. The flow field of the ejector was analysed using different EOS after grid-dependent learning. The results show that the performance of the ejector was underestimated under the ideal gas model; the entrainment ratio was 20–40 per cent lower than when using the real gas model. The effect of the optimal geometrical design and operating conditions will be discussed in Part 2.}
