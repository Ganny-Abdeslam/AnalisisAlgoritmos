abstract = {This article discusses work on implementing emotional and cultural models into synthetic graphical characters. An architecture, FAtiMA, implemented first in the antibullying application FearNot! and then extended as FAtiMA-PSI in the cultural-sensitivity application ORIENT, is discussed. We discuss the modelling relationships between culture, social interaction, and cognitive appraisal. Integrating a lower level homeostatically based model is also considered as a means of handling some of the limitations of a purely symbolic approach. Evaluation to date is summarised and future directions discussed.}

abstract = {This article describes a study of educational outcomes for 0- to 8-year-old children with blindness and low vision (BLV) who are learning sonification concepts. Children with BLV experience barriers to accessing education and careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), fields which traditionally rely heavily on visual representation of information. There is growing awareness of the potential of sonification, a technology to represent data and information in non-speech audio, to improve education access. While early learning of assistive technology skills is deemed essential for equity of access to education across the curriculum, children are generally not introduced to the concept of sonification at school until at academic level in secondary or tertiary education. Little is known about how young children with BLV engage with this promising technology. First, ‘CosmoBally on Sonoplanet’ is introduced, an accessible, educational game application for iPads and Android tablets. Then findings are shared from an anonymous online survey that collected formal responses from users of this app, using a combination of Likert-type scale and open-ended questions. The majority of the 17 respondents were (specialist) educators, and five of the respondents identified as having BLV. The survey investigated respondents’ perceptions of the capabilities of young children with BLV in using basic sonification in ‘CosmoBally on Sonoplanet’ to identify shapes – including a circle – to orientate in a digital grid and to create drawings on a touch screen. Results suggest that young children with BLV can learn sonification skills and additionally may build relevant non-sonification skills during this learning process. This article aims to provide a first insight into best practice around early learning of sonification as a potential tool for increased access and inclusion of children with BLV to STEM subjects in school.}

abstract = {A small-scale computational general equilibrium model is used to examine the efficiency costs of exempting commercial nonprofits from the corporate income tax when they compete directly with for-profit firms. Simulation results from differential-incidence experiments indicate significant welfare gains when the tax wedge is reduced at the margin between the for-profit and nonprofit firms and the change in government revenue is financed by lump-sum taxes. However, although welfare gains exist at the margin, average excess burden estimates suggest that some level of differential taxation is welfare-improving if nonprofits contribute to the production of a good with positive externalities. Results are compared with those from the literature on the differential taxation of corporate and noncorporate firms and are found generally consistent.}

abstract = {Introduction: The volume of blood flowing through the vascular access is an important parameter necessary to provide adequate dialysis for a functional arteriovenous fistula. Higher blood flows are seen in arteriovenous access that receive inflow from larger arteries such as brachial or axillary compared to those based on medium-caliber radial or ulnar arteries. We hypothesized that an anatomic difference in the length and the diameter of the artery is an important determinant of the flow volume in arteriovenous fistula created at different anatomic locations. Methods: Using computational fluid dynamics, we evaluated the contribution of the length and diameter of inflow artery on simulations performed with geometric models constructed to represent arteriovenous fistula circuits. Lengths and diameters of the inflow artery were altered to mimic arteriovenous fistula created at various locations of the upper extremity with standard and variant anatomy. Results: Models of arteriovenous fistula created with variable lengths and diameters of the inflow artery suggest that the length of the vessel has an inverse linear relationship and the diameter has a direct linear relationship to flow volume. Conclusion: Computational fluid dynamic modeling of arteriovenous fistula can be used to understand the physiologic basis of clinical observations of function. Evaluation of the effect of inflow artery length and diameter helps explain the higher flows seen in arteriovenous fistula created using large caliber arteries for inflow. Computational fluid dynamic modeling helps operators understand the contributions of inflow artery in access function and can guide anastomotic site selection.}

abstract = {Abstract Experimental studies using human volunteers are limited to low acceleration impacts while whole cadavers, isolated cervical spine specimens, and impact dummies do not normally reflect the true human response. Computational modelling offers a cost effective and useful alternative to experimental methods to study the behaviour of the human head and neck and their response to impacts to gain insight into injury mechanisms. This article reports the approach used in the development of a detailed multi-body computational model that reproduces the head and cervical spine of an adult in the upright posture representing the natural lordosis of the neck with mid-sagittal symmetry. The model comprises simplified but accurate representations of the nine rigid bodies representing the head, seven cervical vertebrae of the neck, and the first thoracic vertebra, as well as the soft tissues, i.e. muscles, ligaments, and intervertebral discs. The rigid bodies are interconnected by non-linear viscoelastic intervertebral discs elements in flexion and extension, non-linear viscoelastic ligaments and supported through frictionless facet joints. Eighteen muscle groups and 69 individual muscle segments of the head and neck on each side of the body are also included in the model. Curving the muscle around the vertebrae and soft tissues of the neck during the motion of the neck is also modelled. Simulation is handled by the multi-body dynamic software MSC.visuaNastran4D. Muscle mechanics is handled by an external application, Virtual Muscle, in conjunction with MSC.visuaNastran4D that provides realistic muscle properties. Intervertebral discs are modelled as non-linear viscoelastic material in flexion and extension but represented by ‘bushing elements’ in Visual Nastran 4D, which allows stiffness and damping properties to be assigned to a joint with required number of degrees of freedom of the motion. Ligaments are modelled as non-linear viscoelastic spring-damper elements. As the model is constructed, the cervical spine motion segments are validated by comparing the segment response to published experimental data on the load-displacement behaviour for both small and large static loads. The response of the entire ligamentous cervical spine model to quasi-static flexion and extension loading is also compared to experimental data to validate the model before the effect of muscle stiffening is included. Moreover the moment-generating capacity of the neck muscle elements has been compared against in vivo experimental data. The main and coupled motions of the model segments are shown to be accurate and realistic, and the whole model is in good agreement with experimental findings from actual human cervical spine specimens. It has been shown that the model can predict the loads and deformations of the individual soft-tissue elements making the model suitable for injury analysis. The validation of the muscle elements shows the morphometric values, origins, and insertions selected to be reasonable. The muscles can be activated as required, providing a more realistic representation of the human head and neck. The curved musculature results in a more realistic representation of the change in muscle length during the head and neck motion.}

abstract = {Continuous requirements for more efficient aircrafts lead to the design and analysis of novel propulsion configurations, with an example being the boundary layer ingestion. The complexity and integration challenges in such aircraft synergistic propulsion system characterize the research in this field, driven by the potential benefits. The aim of this article is to investigate the effects of boundary layer ingestion on the aerodynamics of a transonic wing, together with the quality of the flow ingested by the propulsion system. A two-dimensional computational model of a transonic airfoil with boundary layer ingesting propulsion system is developed in order to assess boundary layer ingestion for a commercial air transport at cruise conditions and highlight the complex integration issues arising from such configuration. A parametric analysis of the effects of flight conditions, nacelle geometry and engine operating point, on lift, pressure recovery, distortion, total pressure and velocity distribution at the intake, comes to enhance understanding of the performance of this configuration. The pressure distribution around the airfoil and the boundary layer growth are both substantially affected by the engine operating condition, which is represented by the mass flow ratio, with a direct impact on pressure recovery and lift. Mach number and angle of attack influences on lift and drag ingested are also investigated. Intake size and position on the airfoil appear to have significant effects on lift and losses ingested. In general, the results of this study include several aspects related to wing aerodynamics and ingested flow quality, which may facilitate design and integration of the boundary layer ingestion propulsion system for future commercial aircraft.}

abstract = {Constructionism is at once a learning epistemology, a theory of learning, and a pedagogical approach that literally places education in the hands of learners. Constructionism situates students and mentors together in student-directed, project-oriented environments, often enabled with state-of-the-art computational technologies, to foster playful exploration and experimentation. Over time, shared learning experiences in constructionist environments may lead to the formation of learning cultures. To orient the design of constructionist environments for designers of engineering design education, this paper provides a historical context for Seymour Papert’s development of constructionism and distinguishes it from Jean Piaget’s philosophy of constructivism. Constructionism is introduced as an effort targeted at the reform of traditional education. Examples of constructionist environments for learning are then provided. The applicability of constructionism for the design of learning environments for engineering design is also discussed and observations are given for designing the tools, strategies, and activities that comprise constructionist learning environments for engineering design education.}

abstract = {There is considerable controversy surrounding the study of presidential debates, particularly efforts to connect their content and impact. Research has long debated whether the citizenry reacts to what candidates say, how they say it, or simply how they appear. This study uses detailed coding of the first 2012 debate between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney to test the relative influence of the candidates’ verbal persuasiveness and nonverbal features on viewers’ “second screen” behavior—their use of computers, tablets, and mobile phones to enhance or extend the televised viewing experience. To examine these relationships, we merged two datasets: (1) a shot-by-shot content analysis coded for functional, tonal, and visual elements of both candidates’ communication behavior during the debate; and (2) corresponding real-time measures, synched and lagged, of the volume and sentiment of Twitter expression about Obama and Romney. We find the candidates’ facial expressions and physical gestures to be more consistent and robust predictors of the volume and valence of Twitter expression than candidates’ persuasive strategies, verbal utterances, and voice tone during the debate.}
