abstract = {This article describes a methodology to recognize emotional states through an electroencephalography signals analysis, developed with the premise of reducing the computational burden that is associated with it, implementing a strategy that reduces the amount of data that must be processed by establishing a relationship between electrodes and Brodmann regions, so as to discard electrodes that do not provide relevant information to the identification process. Also some design suggestions to carry out a pattern recognition process by low computational complexity neural networks and support vector machines are presented, which obtain up to a 90.2% mean recognition rate.}

abstract = {The purpose of this descriptive study was to develop a computational fluency performance profile of 224 high school (Grades 9—12) students with mathematics disabilities (MD). Computational fluency performance was examined by grade-level expectancy (Grades 2—6) and skill area (whole numbers: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division; rational numbers: fractions, decimals) using the Mathematics Operations Test— Revised (MOT-R). The findings indicated that these high school students with MD were fluent only in computational skills at the second- and third-grade levels. Computational fluency was found with most whole number basic facts in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Lack of computational fluency was demonstrated on many items dealing with subtraction of multiple digits or items requiring regrouping, most multiplication and division items, and rational number items involving fractions and decimals. The results are discussed in regard to instructional programs and curriculum organization for high school students with MD.}

abstract = {The Latin roots of the word reparations are “re” (again) plus “parere” which means “to give birth to, bring into being, produce”. Together they mean “to make generative once again”. In this sense, the extraction processes that cause labor injustice, ecological devastation, and social degradation cannot be repaired by simply transferring money. Reparations need to take on the full sense of “restorative”: the transition to a decolonial system that can support value generators in the control of their own systems of production, protect the value they create from extraction, and circulate value in unalienated forms that benefit the human and non-human communities that produced that value. With funding from the National Science Foundation, we have developed a research framework for this process that starts with “artisanal labor”: employee-owned business and worker collectives that have people doing what they love, despite low incomes. Focusing primarily on Detroit’s Black-owned urban farms, artisanal textile businesses, Black hair salons, worker collectives, and other community-based production, with additional connections to Indigenous and other communities, we have introduced digital fabrication technologies, sensors, artificial intelligence, server-side apps and other computational support for a transition to unalienated circular value flow. We will report on our investigations with the challenges at multiple scales. At each level, we show how computational supports can act as restorative mechanisms for lost circular value flows, and thus address both past and ongoing disenfranchisement.}

abstract = {One goal of experimental economics is to provide data to identify models that best describe the behavior of experimental subjects and, more generally, human economic behavior. We discuss here what we think are the three main steps required to make experimen tal investigations of economic games as statistically informative as possible: finding the solution of the ex perimental game under the postulated equilibrium or other economic models, selecting from a potential class of experimental designs the optimal one for dis criminating between those models, and choosing an optimal stopping rule that indicates when to stop sam pling data and accept one model as the best explana tion of the data. Each step can be computationally in tensive. We offer an algorithmic presentation of the necessary computations in each of the three steps and illustrate these procedures by examples from our re search on learning models in experimental games with incomplete information. These three steps of experi mental design and analysis are not limited to experi mental games, but the computational burden of imple menting these algorithms in other experimental envi ronments—for example, market experiments—requires further considerations with which we have not dealt.}

abstract = {In the conveying process of a solid–liquid two-phase medium, the wear of the flow passage components is unavoidable. In this study, the solid–liquid two-phase flow in a centrifugal pump was numerically simulated by computational fluid dynamics–discrete element method coupling. For particle diameters up to 3 mm, the particle–particle and particle–wall interactions were considered in the simulation. Two-phase performance and wear experiments for different flow rates and particle concentrations were conducted. The wear experiment was carried out for 48 h at each mass concentration. In these experiments, a paint film method was used to display the wear position, and the wall thickness of the flow passage was measured using an ultrasonic thickness gauge. The results show that the instantaneous wear rate of the impeller, volute, and wear plate in the pump changed periodically with the impeller rotation. The volute wall wear was related to the particle movement. With the increase in the particle mass concentration, the wear rate increased. However, the rate of increase of the wear rate decreased because the particles moved to the wall in the volute to form a particle layer. Increasing the concentration did not linearly increase the effect of the particles on the wall.}

abstract = {Abstract A multi-body computational model of the human head and neck was previously shown to be in good agreement with experimental findings from actual human cervical spine specimens. The model segments were tested in three directions of loading showing main and coupled motions to be accurate and realistic. The model’s ability to predict the dynamic response of the head and neck, when subjected to acceleration pulses representing frontal, lateral, and rear-end impacts, is verified using experimental data derived from sled acceleration tests with human volunteers for 15 g frontal and 7 g lateral impacts and from isolated cervical spine specimen tests for rear-end impacts. Response corridors based on sled acceleration tests with human volunteers for frontal and lateral impacts are used to evaluate the model and investigate the effect of muscle activation on the head-neck motion. Firstly, the impacts are simulated with both passive and active muscle behaviour. Secondly, the local loads in the soft-tissue elements during the frontal impact are analysed. For rear-end impact simulation experiments using ligamentous isolated cervical spine specimens are used to evaluate the model performance before investigating the effects of muscle tensioning. Good agreement with human volunteer response corridors resulting from frontal and lateral impacts, and isolated cervical spine specimen sled test rear-end impact experiments is demonstrated for the model, highlighting the important role the muscles of the neck play in the head-neck response to acceleration impacts. The model is shown to be able to predict the loads and deformations of the cervical spine components making it suitable for injury analysis.}

abstract = {In contrast to traditional models of design process fundamentally defined by the abstract manipulation of objects, this study recognizes that the resources available for rethinking architecture are to be found in a reformulation of its theory and practice. This reformation should be based on non-linear design processes in which dynamic emergence and invention take the place of a linear design process fixed on a particular object evolution. Advances in computation thinking and technology have stimulated the design and formulation of a large number of design software. Its elaboration supposes a new conceptualization of our discipline’s knowledge, in a body of principles and regulations, which commands the artifact’s design and its realization; therefore, it constitutes a preliminary datum for its comprehension, and thereby is of theoretical importance. Despite the continuous increment of power in computers and software capacities, the creative space of freedom defined by them acting as cognitive instruments remains almost unexplored. Therefore, we propose a change from a design knowledge based on objects to one focused on design as a network of processes. In addition, this study explores the concept of Distributed Cognition in order to redefine the use of digital tools in design process as Cognitive Instruments.}

abstract = {John Pollock (1940–2009) was an influential American philosopher who made important contributions to various fields, including epistemology and cognitive science. In the last 25 years of his life, he also contributed to the computational study of defeasible reasoning and practical cognition in artificial intelligence. He developed one of the first formal systems for argumentation-based inference and he put many issues on the research agenda that are still relevant for the argumentation community today. This paper presents an appreciation of Pollock’s work on defeasible reasoning and its relevance for the computational study of argument. In our opinion, Pollock deserves to be remembered as one of the founding fathers of the field of computational argument, while, moreover, his work contains important lessons for current research in this field, reminding us of the richness of its object of study.}

First, a morphological processor is presented which is built on the basis of a linguistic analysis of Greek inflected forms. This is followed by a discussion of how stress applies to words and how stress shift phenomena are taken into account by the morphological processor. In Greek, word stress distribution is important because it represents a major difficulty in every attempt to create a morphological processor which can be used by speech recognition systems, machine readable dictionaries, and machine translation projects involving Greek as source or target language.}
