abstract = {This article discusses interaction between multimodal representations of architectural design knowledge, particularly focusing on relating explicit and implicit types of information. The aim of the presented research is to develop a computational environment that combines several modes of representation, including and integrating different forms of architectural design knowledge. Development of an interactive digital-models library and ontological model of architectural design factors are discussed, which are complementary in nature. In a time when BIM software is seen as embodiment of domain knowledge and the future medium of architectural design, this paper presents an interaction between ontological representation of architectural design knowledge and its embodiment in interactive models, thus focusing on the process of design and design space exploration. In the digital environments that we propose, representation of different formats of knowledge, such as visual, linguistic or numeric, are integrated with relational and procedural information, design rules, and characteristics. Interactive search and query based on contextual constraints, and parametric variation of the model based on the information received from ontology are the underlying drivers for design exploration and development.}

abstract = {To fully study the relationship between the internal flow field and hemolysis index in an axial flow blood pump, a computational fluid dynamics–discrete element method coupled calculation method was used. Through numerical analysis under conditions of 6000, 8000, and 10,000 r/min, it was found that there was flow separation of blood cell particles in the tip of the impeller and the guide vane behind the impeller. The flow field has a larger pressure gradient distribution, which reduces the lift ratio of the blood pump and easily causes blood cell damage. The study shows that the hemolysis index obtained by the computational fluid dynamics—discrete element method is 4.75% higher than that from the traditional computational fluid dynamics method, which indicates the impact of microcollision between erythrocyte particles and walls on hemolysis index and also further verifies the validity of the computational fluid dynamics–discrete element coupling method. Through the hydraulic and particle image velocimetry experiments of the blood pump, the coincidence between numerical calculation and experiment is analyzed from macro and micro aspects, which shows that the numerical calculation method is feasible.}

abstract = {Bat-inspired (BI) algorithm is a recent metaheuristic optimization technique that simulates echolocation behavior of bats in seeking a design space. Along the same line with almost all metaheuristics, this algorithm also entails a large number of time-consuming structural analyses in structural design optimization applications. This study is focused on improving computational efficiency of the BI algorithm in optimum structural design. The number of structural analyses required by BI algorithm in the course of design optimization is reduced considerably by incorporating an upper bound strategy (UBS) into the solution procedure. The performance of the resulting algorithm, i.e. UBS integrated BI algorithm (UBI), is evaluated in discrete sizing optimization of large-scale steel skeletal structures designed for minimum weight according to American Institute of Steel Construction-Allowable Stress Design provisions. The numerical results verify that the UBI results in a significant gain in the computational efficiency of the standard algorithm.}

abstract = {Heat transfer is a significant factor affecting internal combustion engine efficiency, emissions and performance. This study concentrates on model development for convective heat transfer and near-wall turbulent flow. The solution of complete fluid dynamics equations within the very thin-wall boundary layers is, and will be in the near future, very impractical in engineering scale flows with any present day method. An advanced numerical near-wall treatment method within the Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes framework has been developed. The method solves simplified boundary layer equations for enthalpy, momentum, turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation in wall adjacent cells on cellwise high-resolution subgrids, adaptive to local conditions. The boundary layer equations include temperature gradient–induced density/multicomponent material property variations and complete imbalance contributions, for example, convection, transients, pressure gradient and external sources, in compact forms. The resulting numerical wall functions are valid with near-wall grid resolution ranging from the viscous sublayer to the fully turbulent region, thus avoiding the conflicting near wall resolution requirements of common low–Reynolds and high–Reynolds number turbulence models. The advanced near wall treatment method, comprising the numerical imbalance wall functions and accordingly modified low–Reynolds number turbulence model, is implemented in STAR-CD 4.12, extensively utilized in engine simulations. The near wall treatment method is validated against available measurements and direct numerical simulation data of strongly heated pipe flow. Performance of the near-wall treatment method in engine conjugate heat transfer simulations is also demonstrated. Local and average effects of variable properties and imbalance contributions on piston surface heat transfer, friction and turbulent sources are elaborated and contrasted to the standard high–Reynolds number near-wall treatment.}

abstract = {This paper investigates on a computational simulation of Twaron® fabric against ballistic impact. It proposed a hybrid shell element model considering the strain-rate-sensitive failure criterion. This model innovatively provided a resolution of the yarn level to better capture the unique properties of the woven fabric, such as yarn crimp, sliding contact between yarns, stress transmission on yarns and yarn broken. The fabric is modeled using a hybrid shell element analysis approach aim of reducing the complexity and computational expense while ensuring accuracy. The response characteristics of fabric under high velocity ballistic impact are studied by applying a 3D finite element program DYNA3D in this paper and the experimental investigation had been taken by Shim et al. According to the computational and experimental results, transverse deflection distribution and stress transmission of fabrics are presented. The ballistic limit, energy absorption, remaining velocity are calculated by simulation models and compared with the experimental results. This approach is also validated by comparing it against a 2D uniform shell model and a 3D interlacing shell model. The results show that the hybrid model can accurately reflect the buckling and fluctuation behavior of fabrics and has a relatively few computational consumption at the same time.}

abstract = {A numerical approach using a finite element method (FEM) was performed in order to determine the dielectric constant (ε’) of BaTiO 3—epoxy composites. In order to diminish computational resources and analyse simple models, composite topology was represented by periodic structures based on FCC configurations, but introducing novel packaging protocols, defining the way composites are filled as particle concentration is increased. The dielectric response of these anisotropic and periodic structures was mathematically represented through a quasi-static approximation using the Laplace equation. The amount of inclusions was varied in order to represent diluted and concentrated systems and structures were assessed for the whole feasible range of volume fractions. The numerical results were compared with experimental data concluding that only packaging protocols that consider higher particle—particle interaction are suitable to represent the dielectric behavior of concentrated-composite materials.}

abstract = {While information technology has facilitated the collection of neverbefore-seen quantities of data, these data have not always provided the information needed by transportation professionals to support sound decision making. Computational intelligence (CI) has great potential to support the needs of transportation professionals. CI is a result of synergy among information processing technologies such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), fuzzy sets, and genetic algorithms. As the number of CI applications to transportation problems grows, so does the need to evaluate these systems. The issue of validating and evaluating transportation CI applications is addressed. A case study that evaluates the effectiveness of two CI paradigms, case-based reasoning and ANNs, for estimating the benefits of real-time traffic diversion is presented. The case study illustrates the need for regarding validation and evaluation as a part of the development effort and the need for tuning the design parameters of CI paradigms.}

abstract = {Background literature review, methodology, results, and analysis are presented for a novel approach to approximating wind pressure on tall buildings for the application of generative design exploration and optimisation. The predictions are approximations of time-averaged computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data with the aim of maintaining simulation accuracy but with improved speed. This is achieved through the use of a back-propagation artificial neural network (ANN) with vertex-based shape features as input and pressure as output. The training set consists of 600 procedurally generated tall building models, and the test set of 10 real building models; for all models in both sets, a feature vector is calculated for every vertex. Over the test set, mean absolute errors against the basis CFD are 1.99–4.44% (σ:2. 10–5.09%) with an on-line process time of 14.72–809.98s (0.028s/sample). Studies are also included on feature sensitivity, training set size, and comparison of CFD against prediction times. Results indicate that prediction time is only dependent on the number of test model vertices, and is therefore invariant to basis CFD time.}
