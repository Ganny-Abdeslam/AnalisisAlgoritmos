abstract = {New information and computer technologies transform the social interaction and impose new demands for skills and thinking upon media specialists. The aim of this study is to determine the most effective set of information technologies, which can help media specialists develop competencies and thus stay competitive in the labor market. The research methodology is based on the overview of case studies concerning issues such as technology trends, human capital, and talent competitiveness. The qualitative analysis was performed in three phases – overviewing case studies, distinguishing trends and problem-solving. Analyzing data on skill supply and demand, the key skills needed to succeed in the workplace were identified. The results of the three-phase research revealed that the most important competencies needed to be in demand today are technology literacy, stress tolerance, and big data skills. The major finding of this study is that a media specialist needs to focus on learning throughout his life and gain hard and soft skills in the process.}

abstract = {Hybrid girihs refer to Islamic geometric patterns that include various stars/rosettes in their final pattern. In this paper, we first identified historical hybrid girihs and then categorized them based on symmetry groups and the number of stars/rosettes folds. In the next step, we analyzed the existing hybrid girihs to identify the generative parameters and present a method for generating historical and novel systematic and non-systematic hybrid girihs. The proposed method of this paper is a computational and parametric approach based on the symmetry groups theory. Its general steps include generating the minimal essential information (template motif) within the fundamental region, applying appropriate symmetry operations on the content of the fundamental region to create the content of the unit girih, and replicating the content of the unit girih in a suitable network according to the symmetry group to create the whole pattern. Our method is used to generate hybrid girih for adorning surfaces in digital spaces and for constructing facade modules (adorned with Islamic geometric patterns) and interior decorative partitions and furniture in physical spaces according to the aesthetic judgment of users.}

abstract = {As technologically gifted students apply their abilities to computer science, they naturally flow through the talent development stages of potential, competency, and expertise. Processes that have always been important for gifted students to learn as they develop potential are embedded in learning code, which engages the beginning programmer in rich and complex authentic projects (Housand et al., 2017). As stakeholders present opportunities for open-ended, creative processes and products, the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA; 2017) and International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE; 2016) Standards can form guidelines for gifted students to self-direct their education through technology. Learning to code results in both cognitive and psychosocial skill development, including creative and critical thinking, logical and systematic reasoning, positive risk-taking and processing of feedback, perseverance through challenges, social skills, and collaboration.}

abstract = {Self-learning is receiving great attention internationally in different fields, along with the best utilization of different computational applications or methods. This paper introduces a novel computational approach for supporting Architectural Design Education (ADE) in its early stages; a computational implementation through MATLAB has been developed to conduct the proposed processes. As a scope, spaces’ furnishing design has been selected to demonstrate the proposed computational approach and implementation, while office workspaces have been selected as a representative case. However, the proposed approach provides and enhances ADE through three main concepts: (a) generating design alternatives for different cases of furnishing spaces, (b) providing accurate and flexible evaluations to students’/designers’ works with different levels, and (c) tracking students based on their defaults and relevant sensitive modifications. Different applications of the proposed approach have been generated, analyzed, and validated.}

abstract = {Piaget’s (1953, 1955) increasingly controversial claim that infant knowledge depends upon action need not be rejected, provided the mechanisms underlying infant ability are conceptualized appropriately in computational terms. Computational concepts solve many problems caused by Piaget’s notions of perception, behaviour, schemes, reciprocal-assimilation and action. Artificial intelligence work on vision offers a way of explaining early perceptual abilities that is precise, internally coherent and able to encompass recent findings of innate organization. Concepts from the procedural programming languages offer a way of accounting for both internal and overt aspects of behaviour, and for the functional coordination of perception and behaviour that characterizes infant anion. This perspective challenges Piaget’s view that development necessitates a radical reconstruction of action-based knowledge. Conceptualized computationally, perceptual-behavioural action can be seen to involve representation in a nontrivial sense. Restructuring of action mechanisms can account for some central phenomena of infant development.}

abstract = {Scratch, a kind of visual programming software, has been widely used in instruction for primary school children. Scratch constructs a digital world for children to design, develop, and create coursework in which their creative thinking is fostered. Different instructional methods have been designed and implemented to stimulate children’s creative thinking skills through their coursework. This study investigated whether scaffolding construction with mind mapping promoted children’s creative thinking in a Scratch course. Two groups of 84 fifth-grade pupils participated in the study. The experimental group of 44 students adopted the scaffolding construction with mind mapping in the Scratch course, while the control group of 40 students did not use the mind mapping method. The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking-Figural (TTCT-F) and Torrance Creative Personality Self-Report Scale were used three times over the 16-week learning period. The results show that learning in the Scratch course promoted the children’s creative thinking. The difference between the two groups indicates that mind mapping was beneficial to improve the children’s creative thinking.}

abstract = {This study investigated the effect of educational board games and the creative thinking spiral teaching strategy (CTSTS) on the learning outcomes of beginner-level Chinese language learners. Two dimensions were measured: learning outcome and writing ability. A total of 82 learners from one university in Taiwan participated in this study. Participants were non-randomly selected using convenience sampling. The participants were divided into the control group (40 participants) and experimental group (42 participants). In the control group, the teacher used the board game “Conveyance GO” as a teaching tool; in the experimental group, both Conveyance GO and CTSTS were used to teach the Chinese language. The results indicate no significant difference in learning outcomes between the groups. However, the experimental group exhibited a significantly larger improvement in writing abilities than did the control group, especially in terms of cohesion, coherence, and grammatical accuracy.}

abstract = {This commentary lays out a framework for building on early critical cartographic and critical geographic information system work to develop a critical approach for the computational future of geographical thought and praxis. Computation – as a highly representational and structural form which combines speech and action – is a very particular way of building worlds. As computation becomes more prevalent in critiques of deep fakes, GeoAI, and platform geographies, geographers have also developed the foundations for a critical computational approach with an explicitly spatial or geographical focus that combines both theory and practice. Yet, while many of the technological affordances of spatial computation are relatively novel, the critiques raised by social, political, economic, and cultural geographers shadow debates that emerged two decades ago between cartographers and geospatial scientists about the power and praxis of mapping as it becomes translated into a digital era. This commentary argues that by returning to these debates, as well as critique by Black, queer, and Indigenous computing seen in other disciplines, geographers find themselves in a moment of opportunity to deeply influence the future of computation via a situated, critical geographical thought and praxis.}

abstract = {Coding is increasingly popular in schools around the world and is often taught by non-specialist teachers as an integrated task with other subject areas. In this article, we explore the relationship between computer science (CS) concepts and students’ multimodal expression in a coding animated narrative (CAN) task in the context of an integrated English-Technology unit of learning. Through this collective case study, we explore how CS concepts underpin semiotic elements of an animated narrative, analyse the factors that influence the extent to which students exercise those concepts, and reveal the tensions and opportunities that a CAN task may present for learning computer science concepts in regular, non-specialist, cross-curricular classrooms. The findings suggest that CAN tasks are unique in presenting opportunities for students to learn challenging CS concepts such as synchronisation and parallelism. At the same time, CAN tasks present tensions for teaching CS concepts in non-specialist classrooms, where student projects are often judged on their visual qualities. In such settings, procedural, rather than conceptual knowledge, may be a more efficient route to creative outcomes. It also means that drawing skills need to be prioritised. Role specialisation often led to better quality projects but at the expense of individual students’ conceptual development in computer science.}
