abstract = {Computational design affords agency: the ability to orchestrate the material, spatial, and technical architectural system. In this specific case, it occurs through enhanced, authored means to facilitate making and performance—typically driven by concerns of structural optimization, material use, and responsivity to environmental factors—of an atmospheric rather than social nature. At issue is the positioning of this particular manner of agency solely with the architect auteur. This abruptly halts—at the moment in which fabrication commences—the ability to amend, redefine, or newly introduce fundamentally transformational constituents and their interrelationships and, most importantly, to explore the possibility for extraordinary outcomes. When the architecture becomes a functional, social, and cultural entity, in the hands of the idealized abled-bodied user, agency—especially for one of an otherly body or mind—is long gone. Even an empathetic auteur may not be able to access the motivations of the differently-abled body and neuro-divergent mind, effectively locking the constraints of the design process, which creates an exclusionary system to those beyond the purview of said auteur. It can therefore be deduced that the mechanisms or authors of a conventional computational design process cannot eradicate the exclusionary reality of an architectural system. Agency is critical, yet a more expansive terminology for agent and agency is needed. The burden to conceive of capacities that will always be highly temporal, social, unpredictable, and purposefully unknown must be shifted far from the scope of the traditional directors of the architectural system. Agency, and who it is conferred upon, must function in a manner that dissolves the distinctions between the design, the action of designing, the author of design, and those subjected to it.}

abstract = {Psychiatric research is undergoing significant advances in an emerging subspeciality of computational psychiatry, building on cognitive neuroscience research by expanding to neurocomputational modeling. Here, we illustrate some research trends in this domain using work on proactive cognitive control deficits in schizophrenia as an example. We provide a selective review of formal modeling approaches to understanding cognitive control deficits in psychopathology, focusing primarily on biologically plausible connectionist-level models as well as mathematical models that generate parameter estimates of putatively dissociable psychological or neural processes. We illustrate some of the advantages of these models in terms of understanding both cognitive control deficits in schizophrenia and the potential roles of effort and motivation. Further, we highlight critical future directions for this work, including a focus on establishing psychometric properties, additional work modeling psychotic symptoms and their interaction with cognitive control, and the need to expand both behavioral and neural modeling to samples that include individuals with different mental health conditions, allowing for the examination of dissociable neural or psychological substrates for seemingly similar cognitive impairments across disorders.}

abstract = {The space layout problem encompasses challenges that rely on a diverse range of contexts regarding urban planning and architectural design, during the traditional design phases which require immense effort and time for the evaluation of the spatial elements’ characteristic needs. In order to eliminate the burden of considering all multidimensional design aspects at the same time, this research presents a three-bodied computational method for locating the spaces of the given architectural design program in a project site, according to the defined list of design objectives and criteria. Besides the determination of the layout according to the requirements of the spatial elements, this research proposes an integration of the space syntax theory’s analytical compounds in terms of Justified Graph Analysis and Integration Values as the fitness criteria for the multi-objective evolutionary optimization in the computational model. To satisfy the integrity levels of each various characterized element within site organization, that are implied inherently by the architectural design program and generate a sustainable space network layout for the project site.}

abstract = {This paper describes a computational model of optical flow and demonstrates how it can be used to estimate the navigation velocity of the user’s viewpoint during a virtual reality (VR) simulation. The model takes as input a VR simulation video sequence and outputs the estimated average navigation velocity. When this estimated velocity is integrated into the published cybersickness dose value model (CSDV: So, 1999), the severity level of the cybersickness associated with the VR simulation can be predicted. Results of two simulation studies indicated that the average navigation velocities in lateral and vertical axes can be estimated to within 10% error. The simulations used a virtual environment (VE) with a known single depth. Discussion of an extension of the computational model to accommodate VEs with unknown multiple depths is included. The reported model is consistent with the biological neuro-pathway of the perception of visual motion velocities in humans. The benefits associated with this consistency are discussed.}

This study provides an overview of the computational intelligence methods developed for the corrosion damage assessment of aerospace materials and structures. Specifically, cellular automata modeling of corrosion pit initiation and growth, wavelet based image processing methods for corrosion damage assessment, and artificial neural networks (ANNs) for material loss and residual strength predictions. In addition, ANN based prediction of life due to corrosion-fatigue conditions are considered and presented. Results obtained from selected computational intelligence methods are compared to the existing alternate solutions and experimental data.

abstract = {Background The creation and management of an autologous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) as vascular access (VA) for hemodialysis patients is still a critical procedure. The placement of a functional and long-lasting VA derives from adequate planning of the surgical procedure based on physical examination, vascular mapping and selection of the best modality for arteriovenous anastomosis. The risk of AVF non-maturation and early failure is high, even when all precautions are taken to minimize these events. In addition, AVF surgery may develop very high blood flow exposing the patient to the risk of heart failure or hand ischemia. Methods The choices of the surgeons on the modalities to perform a surgical intervention for AVF should take into consideration several factors including patient clinical condition, arterial and venous vessel sizes and elasticity. However, these evaluations cannot give direct indication on VA outcome in terms of blood flow after AVF maturation. We then took advantage of theoretical models of vascular network hemodynamics and of computational fluid dynamics to develop a numerical tool for the prediction of potential blood flow of a planned VA surgery on the basis of preoperative ultrasound evaluation of arterial and venous sizes and blood flow. Results Here we present the numerical model, previously developed and tested, and we describe the web-based application that has been developed to help during surgical planning. Conclusions The use of this tool in the clinical setting should allow to reduce the incidence of AVF non-maturation as well as incidence of VA complications.}
