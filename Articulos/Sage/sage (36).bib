abstract = {McShane et al.’s (2024) wide-ranging critique of null hypothesis significance testing provides a number of specific suggestions for improved practice in empirical research. This commentary amplifies several of these from the perspective of computational statistics—particularly nonparametrics, resampling/bootstrapping, and Bayesian methods—applied to common research problems. Throughout, the author emphasizes estimation (as opposed to testing) and uncertainty quantification through a comprehensive process of “curating” a variety of graphical and tabular evidence. Specifically, researchers should be encouraged to estimate the quantities that matter, with as few assumptions as possible, in multiple ways, then try to visualize it all, documenting their pathway from data to results for others to follow.}

abstract = {The development of a real-time driving simulator involves highly complex integrated and interdependent subsystems that require a large amount of computational time. When advanced hardware is unavailable for economic reasons, achieving real-time simulation is challenging, and thus delays are inevitable. Moreover, computational delays in the response of driving simulator subsystems reduce the fidelity of the simulation. In this paper, we propose a technique to decrease computational delays in a driving simulator. We used approximation techniques, sensitivity analysis, decomposition, and sampling techniques to develop a surrogate-based vehicle dynamic model (SBVDM). This global surrogate model can be used in place of the conventional vehicle dynamic model to reduce the computational burden while maintaining an acceptable accuracy. Our results showed that the surrogate model can significantly reduce computing costs compared to the computationally expensive conventional model. In addition, the response time of the SBVDM is nearly five times faster than the original simulation codes. Also, as a method to reduce hardware cost, the SBVDM was used and the results showed that most of the responses were accurate and acceptable in relation to longitudinal and lateral dynamics. Based on the results, the authors suggested that the proposed framework could be useful for developing low-cost vehicle simulation systems that require fast computational output.}

abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics has become an important tool for studying blood flow dynamics. As an in-silico collection of methods, computational fluid dynamics is noninvasive and provides numerical values for the most important parameters of blood flow, such as velocity and pressure that are crucial in hemodynamic studies. In this primer, we briefly explain the basic theory and workflow of the two most commonly applied computational fluid dynamics techniques used in the congenital heart disease literature: the finite element method and the finite volume method. We define important terminology and include specific examples of how using these methods can answer important clinical questions in congenital cardiac surgery planning and perioperative patient management.}

abstract = {Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) operation for coronary artery disease with different types of grafts has a large clinical application world wide. Immediately after this operation patients are usually relieved of their chest pain and have improved cardiac function. However, after a while, these bypass grafts may fail due to for example, neointimal hyperplasia or thrombosis. One of the causes for this bypass graft failure is assumed to be the blood flow with low wall shear stress. The aim of this research is to estimate the wall shear stress in a graft and thus to locate areas were wall shear stress is low. This was done with the help of a blood flow computer model. Postoperative biplane angiograms of the graft were recorded, and from these the three-dimensional geometry of the graft was reconstructed and imported into the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program FLUENT. The stationary diastolic flow through the grafts was calculated, and the wall shear stress distribution was estimated. This procedure was carried out for one native vessel and two different types of bypass grafts. One bypass graft was a saphenous vein and the other one was a varicose saphenous vein encased in a fine, flexible metal mesh. The mesh was attached to give the graft a defined diameter. The computational results show that each graft has distinct areas of low wall shear stress. The graft with the metal mesh has an area of low wall shear stress (< 1 Pa, stationary flow), which is four times smaller than the respective areas in the other graft and in the native vessel. This is thought to be caused by the smaller and more uniform diameter of the metal mesh-reinforced graft.}

abstract = {The paper seeks to lay open the computational logic by which reality is rendered as information. Computation is claimed to involve a drift away from the palpable and extendible character of things, a trend that both continues and breaks with the prevailing strategies of technological mediation in industrialism and modernity. Computation entails the relentless analytic reduction of the composite character and complexion of the world. Reality is meticulously dissolved and regained after a long analytic retreat and technological reconstruction. The outcome of this analytic strategy is that processes taking place at the human-technology interface are sustained by an elaborate vertical stratification, entailing a variety of other programmes and systems that reach down from the level of the interface to machine language and the mechanics of binary parsing. The deepening involvement of computation in instrumental settings thus reframes the perceptive and action modalities by which human agents confront the world. This way, a coherent set of techniques for building up reality is established accompanied by a new model of human agency that increasingly takes the form of a combinatoria of data and information items, remaking the shape of things out of the digital fragments produced by computation.}

abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate hemodynamic changes during aneurysmal dilatation in chronic type B aortic dissections compared to hemodynamic parameters in the healthy aorta with the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Methods: True lumen (TL)/false lumen (FL) dimensional changes, changes in total pressure (TP), and wall shear stress (WSS) were evaluated at follow-up (FU) compared to initial examination (IE) with transient CFD simulation with geometries derived from clinical image data and inflow boundary conditions from magnetic resonance images. The TL/FL pressure gradient between ascending and descending aorta (DAo) and maximum WSS at the site of largest dilatation was compared to values for the healthy aorta. Results: Hemodynamic changes at site of largest FL dilatation included 77% WSS reduction and 69% TP reduction. Compared to the healthy aorta, pressure gradient between ascending and DAo was a factor of 1.4 higher in the TL and a factor of 1.5 in the FL and increased at FU (1.6 and 1.7, respectively). Maximum WSS at the site of largest dilatation was a factor of 3 lower than that for the healthy aorta at IE and decreased by more than a factor of 2 at FU. Conclusions: The FL dilatation at FU favorably reduced TP. In contrast, unfavorable increase in pressure gradient between ascending and DAo was observed with higher values than in the healthy aorta. Maximum WSS was reduced at the site of largest dilation compared to healthy aorta.}

abstract = {Interfacial phenomena between the wafer and the polishing pad during chemical mechanical polishing are an area of great interest as they affect post-chemical mechanical polishing wafer topographies. Traditionally, the Reynolds equation has been used to predict the fluid pressure between the wafer and the polishing pad. However, with computational fluid dynamics it is possible to predict the fluid pressure and obtain insight into the fluid motion at the leading edge and trailing edge of the wafer. Additionally, computational fluid dynamics allows for the added ability to increase the resolution of the fluid physics to the asperity scale. In this study, a model is developed to predict phenomena related to mixed lubrication chemical mechanical polishing using computational fluid dynamics. Contact mechanics between the wafer and the pad are resolved through a Winkler elastic foundation formulation. The wafer is mounted on a ball joint which allows free rotation to occur. Friction between the wafer and the polishing pad causes the wafer to assume a position which produces a sub-ambient pressure distribution similar to that obtained from experiments. The effects of different table speeds on the interfacial fluid pressure, as predicted by the computational fluid dynamics are presented.}

abstract = {In musicology, there has been a long debate about a meaningful partitioning and description of music history regarding composition styles. Particularly, concepts of historical periods have been criticized since they cannot account for the continuous and interwoven evolution of style. To systematically study this evolution, large corpora are necessary suggesting the use of computational strategies. This article presents such strategies and experiments relying on a dataset of 2000 audio recordings, which cover more than 300 years of music history. From the recordings, we extract different tonal features. We propose a method to visualize these features over the course of history using evolution curves. With the curves, we re-trace hypotheses concerning the evolution of chord transitions, intervals, and tonal complexity. Furthermore, we perform unsupervised clustering of recordings across composition years, individual pieces, and composers. In these studies, we found independent evidence of historical periods that broadly agrees with traditional views as well as recent data-driven experiments. This shows that computational experiments can provide novel insights into the evolution of styles.}
