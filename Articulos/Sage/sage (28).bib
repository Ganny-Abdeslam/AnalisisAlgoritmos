abstract = {This commentary elaborates on the ideas and projects outlined in this special issue, from a specifically sociological perspective. Much recent work in sociology proposes ‘methods mashups’ of ethnography and digital data/computational tools in different and diverse ways. However, typically, these have taken the form of applying (with or without tweaks) the principles of ethnography to new domains and data types, as if ethnography itself is stable and immutable; that it has a universal set of methodological principles that unify ethnographic practice. Returning to anthropology (whence, arguably, ethnography originally came) is, therefore, a useful way to extend our methodological thinking to (re)consider what ethnography is and how it operates, and from there think more clearly about how it may be effectively combined with digital data/computational tools in an emerging ‘Computational Anthropology’.}

abstract = {The space layout problem encompasses challenges that rely on a diverse range of contexts regarding urban planning and architectural design, during the traditional design phases which require immense effort and time for the evaluation of the spatial elements’ characteristic needs. In order to eliminate the burden of considering all multidimensional design aspects at the same time, this research presents a three-bodied computational method for locating the spaces of the given architectural design program in a project site, according to the defined list of design objectives and criteria. Besides the determination of the layout according to the requirements of the spatial elements, this research proposes an integration of the space syntax theory’s analytical compounds in terms of Justified Graph Analysis and Integration Values as the fitness criteria for the multi-objective evolutionary optimization in the computational model. To satisfy the integrity levels of each various characterized element within site organization, that are implied inherently by the architectural design program and generate a sustainable space network layout for the project site.}

abstract = {Abstract Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) probably plays a greater part in the aerodynamic design of turbomachinery than it does in any other engineering application. For many years the design of a modern turbine or compressor has been unthinkable without the help of CFD and this dependence has increased as more of the flow becomes amenable to numerical prediction. The benefits of CFD range from shorter design cycles to better performance and reduced costs and weight. This paper presents a review of the main CFD methods in use, discusses their advantages and limitations and points out where further developments are required. The paper is concerned with the application of CFD and does not describe the numerical methods or turbulence modelling in any detail.}

abstract = {Objectives: Competent velopharyngeal (VP) function is the basis for normal speech. Understanding how VP structure influences the airflow during speech details is essential to the surgical improvement of pharyngoplasty. In this study, we aimed to illuminate the airflow features corresponding to various VP closure states using computed dynamic simulations. Methods: Three-dimensional models of the upper airways were established based on computed tomography of 8 volunteers. The velopharyngeal port was simulated by a cylinder. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were applied to illustrate the correlation between the VP port size and the airflow parameters, including the flow velocity, pressure in the velopharyngeal port, as well as the pressure in oral and nasal cavity. Results: The airflow dynamics at the velopharynx were maintained in the same velopharyngeal pattern as the area of the velopharyngeal port increased from 0 to 25 mm2. A total of 5 airflow patterns with distinct features were captured, corresponding to adequate closure, adequate/borderline closure (Class I and II), borderline/inadequate closure, and inadequate closure. The maximal orifice area that could be tolerated for adequate VP closure was determined to be 2.01 mm2. Conclusion: Different VP functions are of characteristic airflow dynamic features. Computational fluid dynamic simulation is of application potential in individualized VP surgery planning.}

abstract = {It is often claimed that computational methods for examining textual data give good enough party position estimates at a fraction of the costs of many non-computational methods. However, the conclusive testing of these claims is still far from fully accomplished. We compare the performance of two computational methods, Wordscores and Wordfish, and four non-computational methods in estimating the political positions of parties in two dimensions, a left-right dimension and a progressive-conservative dimension. Our data comprise electoral party manifestos written in Finnish and published in Finland. The non-computational estimates are composed of the Chapel Hill Expert Survey estimates, the Manifesto Project estimates, estimates deriving from survey-based data on voter perceptions of party positions, and estimates derived from electoral candidates’ replies to voting advice application questions. Unlike Wordfish, Wordscores generates relatively well-performing estimates for many of the party positions, but despite this does not offer an even match to the non-computational methods.}

abstract = {Background The creation and management of an autologous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) as vascular access (VA) for hemodialysis patients is still a critical procedure. The placement of a functional and long-lasting VA derives from adequate planning of the surgical procedure based on physical examination, vascular mapping and selection of the best modality for arteriovenous anastomosis. The risk of AVF non-maturation and early failure is high, even when all precautions are taken to minimize these events. In addition, AVF surgery may develop very high blood flow exposing the patient to the risk of heart failure or hand ischemia. Methods The choices of the surgeons on the modalities to perform a surgical intervention for AVF should take into consideration several factors including patient clinical condition, arterial and venous vessel sizes and elasticity. However, these evaluations cannot give direct indication on VA outcome in terms of blood flow after AVF maturation. We then took advantage of theoretical models of vascular network hemodynamics and of computational fluid dynamics to develop a numerical tool for the prediction of potential blood flow of a planned VA surgery on the basis of preoperative ultrasound evaluation of arterial and venous sizes and blood flow. Results Here we present the numerical model, previously developed and tested, and we describe the web-based application that has been developed to help during surgical planning. Conclusions The use of this tool in the clinical setting should allow to reduce the incidence of AVF non-maturation as well as incidence of VA complications.}

abstract = {Background. Learning programming is a cognitively demanding field of study accompanied with various difficulties. Although there is a high demand in the market for programmers, software analysts and engineers, a high dropout rate is recorded in relevant fields of study. Serious games are a promising means of engaging students in learning programming by giving them more incentives and making the process of learning programming concepts and languages more entertaining. Aim. This article introduces a new serious game called PY-RATE ADVENTURES, which aims to assist young students in their introduction to the basic programming concepts using Python. The game does not have any prerequisites and is suitable for players with no previous knowledge of programming. This article aims to present important information regarding the analysis, design and pilot evaluation of PY-RATE ADVENTURES. Method. The game was evaluated by 31 people that had recently graduated or were students of an Interdepartmental Programme of Postgraduate Studies in Information Systems. The participants voluntarily played the game and answered a questionnaire based on the MEEGA+ model, after their hands on experience with the game. This questionnaire’s purpose was to evaluate PY-RATE ADVENTURES in terms of perceived player experience and short-term learning. Results. The participants positively evaluated the game almost in all the elements of player experience. Furthermore, the majority of the users consider that the game helped them to learn basic programming concepts in Python and stated that they would prefer to learn programming with this game rather than other teaching methods. Conclusion. The positive results of the pilot evaluation give us the motivation to proceed and evaluate the game with students in secondary education, in order to extract stronger and generalisable conclusions regarding the impact of the game as an educational tool for learning programming concepts.}
