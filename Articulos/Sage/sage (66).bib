abstract = {Abstract The development of physically representative models that allow reliable simulation of the processes under realistic conditions is essential for the development and optimization of fuel cells, the introduction of cheaper materials and fabrication techniques, and the design and development of novel architectures. A three-dimensional, multi-phase, non-isothermal computational fluid dynamics model of a novel, simple to construct, tubular, proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell which works in still or slowly moving air has been developed. The novel tubular geometry enables optimum air access to the cathode without the need for pumps, fans, or similar devices. This comprehensive model accounts for the major transport phenomena such as convective and diffusive heat and mass transfer, electrode kinetics, transport and phase-change mechanism of water, and potential fields in a tubular-shaped air-breathing PEM fuel cell. The model explains many interacting, complex electrochemical, and transport phenomena that cannot be studied experimentally. Three-dimensional results of the species profiles, temperature distribution, potential distribution, and local current density distribution are presented and analysed, with the focus on the physical insight and fundamental understanding. These results provide a solid basis for optimizing the geometry of the PEM fuel cell stack running in a passive mode.}

abstract = {The selection of coals for pulverised coal injection usually consists of evaluating the carbonaceous matter. However, the reduction of permeability in the lower section of the blast furnace with high rates of pulverised coal injection can be associated with remaining ashes from the coal combustion process. The aim of this work is to evaluate the behaviour of coal ashes at high temperatures in relation to their chemical and mineralogical composition. These ashes were submitted to the following analysis: chemical (X-ray fluorescence), mineralogical (X-ray diffraction), fusibility (heating microscopy) and viscosity (rotational viscometer). The software FactSage was also used to evaluate the behaviour of coal ashes. It was observed that samples present different chemical and mineralogical compositions, reflecting in the fusibility and viscosity of ashes. Their proportions and relevant phases were determined by computational thermodynamics and also related to the experimental work.}

abstract = {In this wide-ranging conversation, Berry and Galloway explore the implications of undertaking media theoretical work for critiquing the digital in a time when networks proliferate and, as Galloway claims, we need to ‘forget Deleuze’. Through the lens of Galloway’s new book, Laruelle: Against the Digital, the potential of a ‘non-philosophy’ for media is probed. From the import of the allegorical method from excommunication to the question of networks, they discuss Galloway’s recent work and reflect on the implications of computation for media theory, thinking about media objects, and critical theory.}

abstract = {In associative models of simple conditioning, conductive connections (associations, Hebbian synapses) are strengthened by the repetitive temporal pairing of stimuli. The associations cause the animal to behave more adaptively, but they do not encode information about objectively specifiable properties of the conditioning experience. In information processing (computational) models, the temporal intervals in that experience are timed and the results recorded in memory for later use in computations that determine the decisions whether and when to respond to the conditioned stimulus. The predictions of these latter models depend on the ratios of remembered and currently experienced temporal intervals; hence, they are time-scale invariant. Two examples of empirical time-scale invariance are described: Neither the delay of reinforcement nor the ratio of reinforced to unreinforced presentations of the conditioned stimulus affects rates of acquisition and extinction. Time-scale invariance has far-reaching implications for models of the processes that underlie conditioning, for example, models of Hebbian synapses.}

We investigate the performance of a finite-difference computational fluid dynamics algorithm on a massively parallel computer, the Connection Machine. Of special interest is an implicit time-stepping algorithm; to obtain maximum perfor mance from the Connection Machine, it is necessary to use a nonstandard algorithm to solve the linear systems that arise in the implicit algorithm. We find that the Connection Machine can achieve very high computation rates on both explicit and implicit algorithms. The per formance of the Connection Machine puts it in the same class as today’s most powerful conventional supercomputers.}

abstract = {Constructive matching and response elimination strategies are two primarily used cognitive strategies in Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM), a valid measurement instrument of general intelligence. Identifying strategies is necessary for conducting studies on the relationship between cognitive strategy and other cognitive factors and for cognitive strategy training. However, the strategy identification method used in research is either subjective, or the information in the behavior data is not fully utilized, or it is limited by the size of the sample and cannot be widely used. Therefore, this study trained a convolutional neural network-based visual computational model (CVC) for cognitive strategy identification based on eye movement images. Focusing on the APM, the trained CVC can be used for strategy identification by learning and mining the pattern information in the eye movement images with predefined training labels from a psychometric model. An empirical study was conducted to illustrate the training and application of the CVC. Utilizing the trained CVC and a developed graphical user interface application, the primary finding of the study reveals a high level of agreement in strategy identification between the CVC and the psychometric model, as well as between the CVC and expert judgment. This implies that, akin to the psychometric model, the CVC can be used to identify the two cognitive strategies of constructive matching and response elimination. Overall, the proposed deep learning-based model follows the data-driven perspective and provides a new way of studying cognitive strategy in the APM by presenting objective and quantitative identification results.}

abstract = {Hybrid porous tilting pad bearings with the advantages of gas porous bearings and tilting pad bearings exhibited excellent rotor-supporting performance with high accuracy and stability. Under hybrid lubrication, the transient adaptive motion of the tilting pads was important for the rotordynamic characteristics. A novel fluid–structure interaction model of hybrid porous tilting pad bearings was developed to investigate the transient hydro forces and the pad’s adaptive motion. The rotordynamic coefficients of the hybrid porous tilting pad bearings were identified using the rotor harmonic trajectory. The computational fluid dynamics-fluid–structure interaction model was validated with the experimental data. The effects of eccentricity ratios, rotor speeds, supply pressures, pivot radial stiffnesses, and dampings on the pad adaptive motion and the rotordynamic coefficients were evaluated. The pad self-adaption motions significantly influenced the supporting and vibration-absorbing characteristics of hybrid porous tilting pad bearings.}

abstract = {A theoretical computational method to evaluate the performance characteristics of cycloidal propellers is presented. Starting from Taniguchi’s method, improvements have been derived to make it applicable for various eccentricities in the whole advance coefficient region. First the effect of the curved orbit of the blades and the blade rotation is taken into account, that influences camber and zero lift angle. Then the effect of low Reynolds number on drag coefficient and the effect of stalling on lift coefficient are analysed and discussed in detail. Some linearizations are given up to improve the computation accuracy. The improved method is described. Using this improved method to compute the performance of a DTNSRDC model and comparing the results with systematic experiment results (see DTNSRDC Report 2983), it is shown that the agreement between them is quite good for a larger range of advance ratios and eccentricities.}

abstract = {Abstract The piston bowl design is one of the most important factors that affect the air/fuel mixing and the subsequent combustion and pollutant formation processes in a direct injection diesel engine. The bowl geometry and dimensions, such as the pip region, the bowl lip area and the torus radius, are all known to have an effect on the in-cylinder mixing and combustion process. In order to understand better the effect of the pip region, three piston bowls with different pip designs but with the same lip area and torus radius were designed and investigated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) engine modelling. A commercial CFD KIVA3V with improved submodels was used to model the in-cylinder flows and combustion process, and it was validated on a high-speed direct injection (HSDI) engine with a second-generation common rail fuel injection system. The engine performance, in-cylinder flow and combustion and emission characteristics were analysed at maximum power and maximum torque conditions and at part-load operating conditions. Three injector protrusions and injection timings were investigated at full load conditions. The effect of injection timing and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) at the part-load condition was considered.}
