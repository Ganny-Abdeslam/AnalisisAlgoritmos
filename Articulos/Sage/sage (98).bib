abstract = {The two-dimensional Kelvin-Helmholtz instability which arises in two immiscible co-currently moving horizontal liquid layers is studied numerically. Two different methods for capturing the free interface movement are applied, namely the volume-of-fluid method and the level-set method. Both methods are very popular and available within commercial computational fluid dynamics tools. The wave is initialized using two different perturbations implemented into the model. As a case study, a system comprising a toluene layer and an aqueous layer is chosen. Numerical results obtained by both methods are in a good agreement with the linear stability theory for small wave amplitudes. The application of both methods is compared and their advantages and drawbacks are highlighted.}

abstract = {Abstract A number of modelling approaches, such as enterprise modelling, simulation modelling, and causal loop diagramming, have been used independently for designing systems of different kinds, such as machine systems, social systems, and production systems. Enterprise modelling has its roots in control system design. Simulation modelling has generally been used in re-engineering and optimizing production and service processes, whereas causal loop diagramming (systems thinking) has generally been used for systems designing in management and social sciences. This paper describes the combined use of these three modelling approaches which carry complementary concepts that can be used together for supporting management decisions in designing and changing complex manufacturing enterprises. A decision support framework is presented that is instrumented with combined use of these three modelling approaches and has been tested in production management-related decision making.}

abstract = {In this paper the characteristics and performance are described of a computational process model (CPM) of human way-finding that is based on psychological models of cognition and experimental data on human way-finding. The model comprises two modules, one for representing objectively a suburban environment and the other for representing the cognitive processes involved in navigation. The CPM is employed to simulate and investigate how spatial knowledge that has been acquired and stored is retrieved and processed in order to plan a path to a given goal. The results of the experiments carried out with NAVIGATOR are compared with the results of experiments involving young adults in real environments. We analyze the performance of NAVIGATOR in terms of its ability to find the goal, the amount of time taken to reach a given goal, the differences in performance during way-finding, and the errors in navigation, as a function of several parameters. The parameters are intended to represent key psychological components of human perceptual and cognitive systems and are derived from experimental studies of human way-finding behavior. The main value of this model lies in its use as a device for investigating and understanding human spatial performance, in terms of accurate performance and errors that arise in tasks of way-finding, and the variations among individuals in terms of performance. A set of computational experiments are used to examine the differences in search strategies between ‘individuals’. The effects of various parameters on way-finding performance are analyzed. Errors in way-finding are classified and are compared with Norman’s and Reason’s classification of errors in human performance. The CPM appears to provide a fruitful model for investigating human way-finding behavior.}

abstract = {Abstract Hemming is a three-step sheet-folding process utilized in the production of automotive closures. It has a critical imact on the performance and perceived quality of assembled vehicles. Using a two-dimensional finite element model, this paper presents a design-of-experiments (DOE) study of the relationships between important hemming process parameters and hem quality for aluminium alloy AA 6111-T4PD flat surface-straight edge hemming. The quality measures include roll-in/roll-out of the hem edge as well as the maximum true strain on the exposed bent surface. The finite element (FE) model combines explicit and implicit procedures in simulating the three forming subprocesses (flanging, pre-hemming, and final hemming) along with the corresponding springback (unloading). The results show that the pre-hemming die angle and the flanging die radius have the greatest influence on hem edge roll-in/roll-out, while pre-strain and the flanging die radius impact the maximum surface strain significantly. The computational DOE results also provide the basis for process parameter selection to avoid hem surface cracking and particular insights for achieving acceptable formability.}

abstract = {Recently there has been an increase in the number of researchers who use rational choice models to explain single cases and rare events. Because of the small number of cases under study, these researchers must rely either explicitly or implicitly on counterfactual reasoning. This paper argues that computational methods provide a profitable means of carrying out rigorous counterfactual analysis. The authors advocate robustness analysis as one important part of the counterfactual analysis of formal theories. Specifically, they evaluate the robustness of the behavioral assumptions of two formal models using various heuristic search algorithms and Markov chains. They find that Kuran’s (1989) threshold model of mass protest and Ingberman’s (1985) model of direct-democracy referenda are robust to perturbations in their behavioral assumptions. These findings increase the plausibility of causal claims made by scholars who use these models to explain specific events.}

In a new synthesis that permits straightforward generalization of previously published results, spatial and temporal windowing functions are employed to provide equivalent-source expressions to account for both initial and boundary conditions. Detailed results describe the transformation of both source terms and Green’s functions to take account of uniform subsonic mean flow, and expressions are given for free-field Green’s functions, both with and without flow, in time, frequency and wavenumber domains. A worked example illustrates the non-uniqueness of the Green’s function for a simple one-dimensional bounded problem.}

abstract = {We perform a socio-computational interrogation of the google search by image algorithm, a main component of the google search engine. We audit the algorithm by presenting it with more than 40 thousands faces of all ages and more than four races and collecting and analyzing the assigned labels with the appropriate statistical tools. We find that the algorithm reproduces white male patriarchal structures, often simplifying, stereotyping and discriminating females and non-white individuals, while providing more positive descriptions of white men. By drawing from Bourdieu’s theory of cultural reproduction, we link these results to the attitudes of the algorithm’s designers, owners, and the dataset the algorithm was trained on. We further underpin the problematic nature of the algorithm by using the ethnographic practice of studying-up: We show how the algorithm places individuals at the top of the tech industry within the socio-cultural reality that they shaped, many times creating biased representations of them. We claim that the use of social-theoretic frameworks such as the above are able to contribute to improved algorithmic accountability, algorithmic impact assessment and provide additional and more critical depth in algorithmic bias and auditing studies. Based on the analysis, we discuss the scientific and design implications and provide suggestions for alternative ways to design just socio-algorithmic systems.}

abstract = {Fluid flow in the intertrabecular spaces of vertebral bone has been implicated in a number of physiological phenomena. Despite the potential clinical significance of the flow of various fluids through the intertrabecular cavities, the intrinsic permeability of trabecular bone is not fully characterized or understood. Furthermore, very little is known about the interdependence of permeability and morphological parameters. The main purpose of this study is to characterize computational methods to determine intrinsic bone permeability from three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) image stacks that were, depending on the underlying algorithm of each model, acquired at a spatial resolution ranging from the order of 500 μm (macroscale) up to 10 μm (microscale). A Finite Element formulation of the steady-state Stokes flow and an in house developed pore network modeling approach compute permeability on the microscopic length scale. To approximate the geometry of the trabecular bone network, a cellular model is used to map morphological information into intrinsic permeability by means of a log-linear regression equation. If the image resolution is too low for the quantification of the trabecular bone architecture, permeability is directly derived by fitting a simplified version of the log-linear regression equation to the CT Hounsfield values. Depending on the resolution of the raw image data and the chosen model, permeability value correlations are 0.31 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.90 compared to the Finite Element method, that is referred to as the baseline for any comparisons in this study. Furthermore, we found no significant dependence of the intrinsic permeability on the trabecular thickness parameter.}
