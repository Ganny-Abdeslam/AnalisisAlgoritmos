abstract = {This article describes a methodology to recognize emotional states through an electroencephalography signals analysis, developed with the premise of reducing the computational burden that is associated with it, implementing a strategy that reduces the amount of data that must be processed by establishing a relationship between electrodes and Brodmann regions, so as to discard electrodes that do not provide relevant information to the identification process. Also some design suggestions to carry out a pattern recognition process by low computational complexity neural networks and support vector machines are presented, which obtain up to a 90.2% mean recognition rate.}

abstract = {In this study, free-surface effects on swimming are investigated by the application of the computational fluid dynamics method for the first time. The major goal of this study is to represent a new methodology to numerically investigate free-surface effects on swimming. Utilizing a two-dimensional solver with steady flow conditions, the numerical results for swimming at a fully submerged level are validated with the data presented by previous researchers. The validity of the results is also examined through the study of mesh independency and the control of a critical turbulence feature, entitled as non-dimensional wall distance (y+). Finally, for the analysis of swimming at the free-surface level, a two-dimensional time-dependent solver with a well-known multiphase mathematical model is implemented to simultaneously investigate two-phase flow interactions and wave propagation in the proximity of the swimmer’s body. The development of different flow topology features, including major vortex cores and secondary recirculation zones as well as turbulence mixing and flow updraft and downdraft, are investigated and used to compare free-surface swimming against fully submerged cases. While the drag coefficient continuously decreases for higher advance velocities for a fully submerged case, a gradual augmentation is observed for the drag coefficient at a free-surface swimming level. The obtained results suggest that while the proportion of wave drag is ignorable at low swimming speeds below 1 m/s, in the case of higher speeds, its amount enhances significantly and constitutes about 15% of the total drag. Moreover, the proposed methodology is demonstrated to be efficient in the simulation of flow characteristics and phase interactions in swimming at the free-surface level.}

abstract = {Driver distraction is one of the major causes for fatal car accidents. In a distracting activity, manual distraction is a triggered response of other types of distraction, such as cognitive and visual distraction. Therefore, recognition of manual distraction can contribute to the monitoring of overall drivers’ distraction. In this study, a computer vision-based method to track hand movement from the recorded driving behavior is proposed. This method integrates a low computational cost template matching algorithm using fast normalized cross coefficient (NCC) and a novel searching strategy. The proposed method was evaluated by the VIVA hand tracking data set. It achieves 50.83% of marginal accuracy percentage (mAP), 42.18% of multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA), 31.56% of mostly tracked (MT), and 19.29% of mostly lost (ML), and it outperformed a state of the art algorithm in MOTA and MT. Additionally, the computational cost of the proposed method is greatly improved, and it can run at around 11.1 frames per second. The outcome of this research will further assist driving distraction recognition and mitigation, and improve driving safety.}

abstract = {Bridge aesthetics, an area of great interest to engineers, is recognized as a difficult area to research because of its subjective nature and ill-defined concepts. An innovative computational decision support tool for use in bridge aesthetics is described. The system contains a knowledge base created by using an extensive literature survey and by completing in-depth knowledge elicitation from leading bridge designers in the United Kingdom and with the support of the Department of Transport. To further validate the knowledge base, the rules elicited from the designers were tested against public opinion through a series of questionnaires. This procedure enabled the construction of a knowledge base that supports many aspects of aesthetics for small- to medium-sized span road bridges. This limited domain was chosen because this form of bridge is currently the most commonly constructed in Britain, yet generally receives little attention in terms of aesthetics because of time and economic constraints. The knowledge base has been incorporated into a system aimed at providing interactive advice on comparative bridge design. The system was developed in Visual C + + to run on a personal computer and to operate in a Windows environment. It is currently undergoing prolonged evaluation in practicing bridge design offices. To date, this evaluation has shown that engineers like the system and would find it useful. Therefore, commercial exploitation is currently being explored. The comments received during the evaluation are also being used to further tailor the system to suit practicing engineers’ needs.}

abstract = {Recent developments in I/O systems on scalable parallel computers have sparked renewed interest in out-of-core methods for computational chemistry. These methods can improve execution time significantly relative to direct methods, which perform many redundant computations. However, the widespread use of such out-of-core methods requires efficient and portable implementations of often complex I/O patterns. The ChemlO project has addressed this problem by defining an I/O interface that captures the I/O patterns found in important computational chemistry applications and by providing high performance imple mentations of this interface on multiple platforms. This development broadens the user community for parallel I/O techniques and provides new insights into the functionality required in general purpose scalable I/O libraries and the techniques required to achieve high performance I/O on scalable parallel computers.}

abstract = {High-content screening (HCS) using RNA interference (RNAi) in combination with automated microscopy is a powerful investigative tool to explore complex biological processes. However, despite the plethora of data generated from these screens, little progress has been made in analyzing HC data using multivariate methods that exploit the full richness of multidimensional data. We developed a novel multivariate method for HCS, multivariate robust analysis method (M-RAM), integrating image feature selection with ranking of perturbations for hit identification, and applied this method to an HC RNAi screen to discover novel components of the DNA damage response in an osteosarcoma cell line. M-RAM automatically selects the most informative phenotypic readouts and time points to facilitate the more efficient design of follow-up experiments and enhance biological understanding. Our method outperforms univariate hit identification and identifies relevant genes that these approaches would have missed. We found that statistical cell-to-cell variation in phenotypic responses is an important predictor of hits in RNAi-directed image-based screens. Genes that we identified as modulators of DNA damage signaling in U2OS cells include B-Raf, a cancer driver gene in multiple tumor types, whose role in DNA damage signaling we confirm experimentally, and multiple subunits of protein kinase A.}

First, a morphological processor is presented which is built on the basis of a linguistic analysis of Greek inflected forms. This is followed by a discussion of how stress applies to words and how stress shift phenomena are taken into account by the morphological processor. In Greek, word stress distribution is important because it represents a major difficulty in every attempt to create a morphological processor which can be used by speech recognition systems, machine readable dictionaries, and machine translation projects involving Greek as source or target language.}

abstract = {Polarizationless P systems with active membranes are non-cooperative systems, that is, the left-hand side of their rules have a single object. Usually, these systems make use of division rules as a mechanism to produce an exponential workspace in linear time. Division rules are inspired by cell division, a process of nuclear division that occurs when a parent cell divides to produce two identical daughter cells. On the other hand, separation rules are inspired by the membrane fission process, a mechanism by which a biological membrane is split into two new ones in such a manner that the contents of the initial membrane is distributed between the new membranes. In this paper, separation rules are used instead of division rules. The computational efficiency of these models is studied and the role of the (minimal) cooperation in object evolution rules is explored from a computational complexity point of view.}
