abstract = {This paper introduces the design of an agent-based leadership support system exploiting a computational model for development of individuals or groups. It is to be used, for example, as a basis for systems to support a group leader in the development of individual group members or a group as a whole. Using a computational model for Situational Leadership Theory and model-based reasoning techniques, the system monitors and analyzes the development level over time and provides support to the group leader by proposing for different points in time the most effective leadership behavior according to Situational Leadership Theory. The support model has been formally designed and, within a dedicated software environment, simulation experiments have been performed.}

abstract = {We designed two computational models to replicate human facial attractiveness ratings. The primary model used partial least squares (PLS) to identify image factors associated with facial attractiveness from facial images and attractiveness ratings of those images. For comparison we also made a model similar to previous models of facial attractiveness, in that it used manually derived measurements between features as inputs, though we took the additional step of dimensionality reduction via principal component analysis (PCA) and weighting of PCA dimensions via a perceptron. Strikingly, both models produced estimates of facial attractiveness that were indistinguishable from human ratings. Because PLS extracts a small number of image factors from the facial images that covary with attractiveness ratings of the images, it is possible to determine the information used by the model. The image factors that the model discovered correspond to two of the main contemporary hypotheses of averageness judgments: facial attractiveness and sexual dimorphism. In contrast, facial symmetry was not important to the model, and an explicit feature-based measurement of symmetry was not correlated with human judgments of facial attractiveness. This provides novel evidence for the importance of averageness and sexual dimorphism, but not symmetry, in human judgments of facial attractiveness.}

abstract = {Although the use of the psychological construct of situational awareness (SA) assists researchers in creating a flight environment that is safer and more predictable, its true potential remains untapped until a valid means of predicting SA a priori becomes available. Previous work proposed a computational model of SA (CSA) that sought to fill that void. The current line of research is aimed at validating that model. The results show that the model accurately predicted SA in a piloted simulation.}

abstract = {The aim of this article is to develop a three-dimensional computational model to simulate the traveling process of inlet distortion in fan and compressor with low calculated costs. The model is established based on the body force model in the framework of modern Computational Fluid Dynamics technology. The flow is assumed to be axisymmetric in each meridional blade passage. The impact of the solid blade shapes on airflow is modeled with blade blockage factor and blade body force. The relationships between blade body force and blade inlet Mach number together with attack angle are established with the deviation angle model and loss model. Meanwhile, the effect of the turbulent mixing is also taken into consideration. This developed computational code is then applied to the investigation of a transonic fan rotor and of a four-stage low-speed axial compressor under clean and distorted inlet condition. The predicted performance of both the fan rotor and the four-stage compressor with clean inlet are in line with the experimental results. A quantitative comparison is made between the computational results and the measurement data of the fan rotor with inlet distortion. Additionally, the transfer behavior of inlet distortion in the four-stage compressor is simulated by the model. All results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of the model.}

abstract = {In this study, free-surface effects on swimming are investigated by the application of the computational fluid dynamics method for the first time. The major goal of this study is to represent a new methodology to numerically investigate free-surface effects on swimming. Utilizing a two-dimensional solver with steady flow conditions, the numerical results for swimming at a fully submerged level are validated with the data presented by previous researchers. The validity of the results is also examined through the study of mesh independency and the control of a critical turbulence feature, entitled as non-dimensional wall distance (y+). Finally, for the analysis of swimming at the free-surface level, a two-dimensional time-dependent solver with a well-known multiphase mathematical model is implemented to simultaneously investigate two-phase flow interactions and wave propagation in the proximity of the swimmer’s body. The development of different flow topology features, including major vortex cores and secondary recirculation zones as well as turbulence mixing and flow updraft and downdraft, are investigated and used to compare free-surface swimming against fully submerged cases. While the drag coefficient continuously decreases for higher advance velocities for a fully submerged case, a gradual augmentation is observed for the drag coefficient at a free-surface swimming level. The obtained results suggest that while the proportion of wave drag is ignorable at low swimming speeds below 1 m/s, in the case of higher speeds, its amount enhances significantly and constitutes about 15% of the total drag. Moreover, the proposed methodology is demonstrated to be efficient in the simulation of flow characteristics and phase interactions in swimming at the free-surface level.}

abstract = {A computational fluid dynamics simulation method based on large eddy simulation is presented and applied to compute the sunroof buffeting of a sport utility vehicle. The simulation result, i.e. the buffeting level curve, coincides well with the road test. The simulation method is then employed to investigate the sunroof buffeting of a vehicle during the development process in the range of 30 km/h–90 km/h. The results show that the most severe sunroof buffeting occurs at 70 km/h, which corresponds to the resonant frequency of the cabin. Flow field visualizations reveal that strong pressure fluctuations are generated inside the cabin due to vortex shedding from the leading edge and impinging onto the trailing edge of the sunroof opening, which explains the mechanism of sunroof buffeting. A new deflector with a gap and a notched upper edge is designed to replace the original castle type deflector. The simulation results show that the newly designed deflector can reduce the buffeting level to 97.9 dB; that is, the sunroof buffeting is completely eliminated. Moreover, the phenomenon of sunroof buffeting reduction is explained by comparing and analyzing the flow field between the newly designed deflector and the original deflector.}

abstract = {Computational cognitive models of web-navigation developed so far have largely been tested only on mock-up websites. In this paper, for the first time, we compare and contrast the performance of two models, CoLiDeS and CoLiDeS+, on two real websites from the domains of technology and health, under two conditions of task difficulty, simple and difficult. We found that CoLiDeS+ predicted more hyperlinks on the correct path and had a higher path completion ratio than CoLiDeS. CoLiDeS+ found the target page more often than CoLiDeS, took more steps to reach the target page and was more ‘disoriented’ than CoLiDeS for difficult tasks. Difficult tasks in general for both models had less task success and lower path completion ratio, predicted less hyperlinks on the correct path, visited pages with lower mean LSA and took more steps to complete compared with simple tasks. Overall, inclusion of context from previously visited pages and implementation of backtracking strategies (which are both part of CoLiDeS+) led to better modelling performance. Suggestions to further improve the performance of these computational cognitive models on real websites are discussed.}

abstract = {Driver distraction is one of the major causes for fatal car accidents. In a distracting activity, manual distraction is a triggered response of other types of distraction, such as cognitive and visual distraction. Therefore, recognition of manual distraction can contribute to the monitoring of overall drivers’ distraction. In this study, a computer vision-based method to track hand movement from the recorded driving behavior is proposed. This method integrates a low computational cost template matching algorithm using fast normalized cross coefficient (NCC) and a novel searching strategy. The proposed method was evaluated by the VIVA hand tracking data set. It achieves 50.83% of marginal accuracy percentage (mAP), 42.18% of multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA), 31.56% of mostly tracked (MT), and 19.29% of mostly lost (ML), and it outperformed a state of the art algorithm in MOTA and MT. Additionally, the computational cost of the proposed method is greatly improved, and it can run at around 11.1 frames per second. The outcome of this research will further assist driving distraction recognition and mitigation, and improve driving safety.}

abstract = {Societies differ in susceptibility to social influence and in the social network structure through which individuals influence each other. What implications might these cultural differences have for changes in cultural norms over time? Using parameters informed by empirical evidence, we computationally modeled these cross-cultural differences to predict two forms of cultural change: consolidation of opinion majorities into stronger majorities, and the spread of initially unpopular beliefs. Results obtained from more than 300,000 computer simulations showed that in populations characterized by greater susceptibility to social influence, there was more rapid consolidation of majority opinion and also more successful spread of initially unpopular beliefs. Initially unpopular beliefs also spread more readily in populations characterized by less densely connected social networks. These computational outputs highlight the value of computational modeling methods as a means to specify hypotheses about specific ways in which cross-cultural differences may have long-term consequences for cultural stability and cultural change.}

abstract = {Recent developments in I/O systems on scalable parallel computers have sparked renewed interest in out-of-core methods for computational chemistry. These methods can improve execution time significantly relative to direct methods, which perform many redundant computations. However, the widespread use of such out-of-core methods requires efficient and portable implementations of often complex I/O patterns. The ChemlO project has addressed this problem by defining an I/O interface that captures the I/O patterns found in important computational chemistry applications and by providing high performance imple mentations of this interface on multiple platforms. This development broadens the user community for parallel I/O techniques and provides new insights into the functionality required in general purpose scalable I/O libraries and the techniques required to achieve high performance I/O on scalable parallel computers.}
