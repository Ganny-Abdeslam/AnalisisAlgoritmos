abstract = {This investigation assessed the extent to which elementary-age learning disabled students were able to generalize a computational skill. The subjects consisted of nine students, all of whom made systematic errors in arithmetic. Two experiments were conducted using within-subject designs. All students experienced baseline, demonstration and modeling plus feedback, and maintenance. Students who met criteria for generalizing proceeded to a followup condition, while those who did not received further interventions designed to increase their ability to generalize. The effectiveness of the following procedures was investigated: (a) reinforcing students “to generalize,” and (b) a technique which combined training several response exemplars with the use of a verbal cue and an in-discriminable reinforcement contingency. The results indicated that demonstration and modeling plus feedback was sufficient to increase some students’ ability to generalize; others required further interventions to facilitate generalization.}

abstract = {We present Illuminator, a user-friendly web front end to computational models such as docking and 3D shape similarity calculations. Illuminator was specifically created to allow non-experts to design and submit molecules to computational chemistry programs. As such it provides a simple user interface allowing users to submit jobs starting from a 2D structure. The models provided are pre-optimized by computational chemists for each specific target. We provide an example of how Illuminator was used to prioritize the design of molecular substituents in the Anadys HCV Polymerase (NS5B) project. With 7500 submitted jobs in 1.5 years, Illuminator has allowed project teams at Anadys to accelerate the optimization of novel leads. It has also improved communication between project members and increased demand for computational drug discovery tools.}

A computational model was configured for a driving scenario used in a pilot study that included a secondary task at varying levels of difficulty to increase the driver’s workload. The computational model results provided a workload analysis of the concurrent driving tasks. This analysis can be used to explain the experimental findings from subject experiments and to evaluate the workload trade-offs between primary and secondary driving tasks.}

abstract = {In developed countries, presence at home varies between 60% and 90% of the day, sleeping supposes 30%. Therefore, it is essential to ensure good indoor air quality that enhances health and benefits rest and recovery. In this context, it is necessary to achieve a balance between energy efficiency and air distribution parameters; thus, the influence exerted by the furniture of a bedroom on the air exchange efficiency, in the breathing zone during sleep, is assessed in this study. Computational fluid dynamics techniques, experimentally validated by the tracer gas (SF6) concentration decay method, are used to analyze 52 case studies corresponding to the same space, but varying both the number and the arrangement of the furniture inside. It is concluded that, in order to achieve a significant improvement in the air exchange efficiency, the number of elements included in the bedroom is not relevant, but the position of them. The highest increase in the ventilation efficiency in breathing zone is observed when the furniture is located avoiding the airflow obstruction in the area near the inlet and creating an unfilled volume of air in the area close to the outlet.}

abstract = {This article describes a computational system for the linguistic analysis of language acquisition data (COALA). The system is a combined AI and database tool which allows the user to form highly complex queries about morphosyntactic and semantic structures contained in large sets of data. COALA identifies those sentences that meet the linguistic criteria defined by the user. It allows the user to freely define such linguistic contexts and to step through the sentences identified by the system. COALA then rapidly displays those sentences in their original discourse context. Additionally, COALA can perform statistical analyses in response to structural linguistic queries. This article contains (1) a discussion of the computational approach taken in the design of COALA, (2) a description of the functionality of the system, and (3) a reflection on the validity of the analytical categories contained therein.}

abstract = {Background: There is increasing evidence from animal and clinical studies that network hyperexcitability (NH) may be an important pathophysiological process and potential target for treatment in early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Measures of functional connectivity (FC) have been proposed as promising biomarkers for NH, but it is unknown which measure has the highest sensitivity for early-stage changes in the excitation/inhibition balance. Objective: We aim to test the performance of different FC measures in detecting NH at the earliest stage using a computational approach. Methods: We use a whole brain computational model of activity dependent degeneration to simulate progressive AD pathology and NH. We investigate if and at what stage four measures of FC (amplitude envelope correlation corrected [AECc], phase lag index [PLI], joint permutation entropy [JPE] and a new measure: phase lag time [PLT]) can detect early-stage AD pathophysiology. Results: The activity dependent degeneration model replicates spectral changes in line with clinical data and demonstrates increasing NH. Compared to relative theta power as a gold standard the AECc and PLI are shown to be less sensitive in detecting early-stage NH and AD-related neurophysiological abnormalities, while the JPE and the PLT show more sensitivity with excellent test characteristics. Conclusions: Novel FC measures, which are better in detecting rapid fluctuations in neural activity and connectivity, may be superior to well-known measures such as the AECc and PLI in detecting early phase neurophysiological abnormalities and in particular NH in AD. These markers could improve early diagnosis and treatment target identification.}

abstract = {Aim In current rotary blood pumps, complications related to blood trauma due to shear stresses are still frequently observed clinically. Reducing the rotor tip speed might decrease blood trauma. Therefore, the aim of this project was to design a two-stage rotary blood pump leading to lower shear stresses. Methods Using the principles of centrifugal pumps, two diagonal rotor stages were designed with an outer diameter of 22 mm. The first stage begins with a flow straightener and terminates with a diffusor, while a volute casing behind the second stage is utilized to guide fluid to the outlet. Both stages are combined into one rotating part which is pivoted by cup-socket ruby bearings. Details of the flow field were analyzed employing computational fluid dynamics (CFD). A functional model of the pump was fabricated and the pressure-flow dependency was experimentally assessed. Results Measured pressure-flow performance of the developed pump indicated its ability to generate adequate pressure heads and flows with characteristic curves similar to centrifugal pumps. According to the CFD results, a pressure of 70 mmHg was produced at a flow rate of 5 L/min and a rotational speed of 3200 rpm. Circumferential velocities could be reduced to 3.7 m/s as compared to 6.2 m/s in a clinically used axial rotary blood pump. Flow fields were smooth with well-distributed pressure fields and comparatively few recirculation or vortices. Substantially smaller volumes were exposed to high shear stresses >150 Pa. Conclusions Hence, blood trauma might be reduced with this design. Based on these encouraging results, future in vitro investigations to investigate actual blood damage are intended.}

abstract = {Current theories of artificial intelligence (AI) generally exclude human emotions. The idea at the core of such theories could be described as ‘cognition is computing’; that is, that human psychological and symbolic representations and the operations involved in structuring such representations in human thinking and intelligence can be converted by AI into a series of cognitive symbolic representations and calculations in a manner that simulates human intelligence. However, after decades of development, the cognitive computing doctrine has encountered many difficulties, both in theory and in practice; in particular, it is far from approaching real human intelligence. Real human intelligence runs through the whole process of the emotions. The core and motivation of rational thinking are derived from the emotions. Intelligence without emotion neither exists nor is meaningful. For example, the idea of ‘hot thinking’ proposed by Paul Thagard, a philosopher of cognitive science, discusses the mechanism of the emotions in human cognition and the thinking process. Through an analysis from the perspectives of cognitive neurology, cognitive psychology and social anthropology, this article notes that there may be a type of thinking that could be called ‘emotional thinking’. This type of thinking includes complex emotional factors during the cognitive processes. The term is used to refer to the capacity to process information and use emotions to integrate information in order to arrive at the right decisions and reactions. This type of thinking can be divided into two types according to the role of cognition: positive and negative emotional thinking. That division reflects opposite forces in the cognitive process. In the future, ‘emotional computing’ will cause an important acceleration in the development of AI consciousness. The foundation of AI consciousness is emotional computing based on the simulation of emotional thinking.}
