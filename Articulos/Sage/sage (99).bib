abstract = {Background Maxillary antrostomy is commonly performed during endoscopic sinus surgery. Little is known about the association surrounding recalcitrant maxillary sinusitis, antrostomy size, and intranasal airflow changes. Furthermore, the interaction between sinus mucosa and airflow is poorly understood. This study used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling to investigate postoperative airflow characteristics between diseased and nondiseased maxillary sinuses in subjects with recurrent disease. Methods A retrospective review of patients from a tertiary-level academic rhinology practice was performed. Seven subjects with endoscopic evidence of postoperative maxillary sinus disease that presented as chronic unilateral crusting at least 1 year after bilateral maxillary antrostomies were selected. A three-dimensional model of each subject’s sinonasal cavity was created from postoperative computed tomographies and used for CFD analysis. Results Although the variables investigated between diseased and nondiseased sides were not statistically significant, the diseased side in six subjects had a smaller antrostomy, and five of these subjects had both reduced nasal unilateral airflow and increased unilateral nasal resistance on the diseased side. The ratio of posterior wall shear stress (WSS) of the maxillary sinus to the total WSS was higher on the diseased side in six subjects. Results also showed strong correlations between antrostomy and CFD variables on the diseased side than on the nondiseased side. Conclusion This pilot study showed that the majority of the simulated sinonasal models exhibited common characteristics on the side with persistent disease, such as smaller antrostomy, reduced nasal airflow, increased nasal resistance, and increased posterior WSS. Although statistical significance was not established, this study provided preliminary insight into variables to consider in a larger cohort study.}

abstract = {In spite of the fact that much effort has been expended trying to prove lower bounds for algorithms and trying to solve the P = NP question, only limited progress has been made. Although most computer scientists remain convinced that solutions will be found, others (Hartmanis and Hopcroft, Fortune, Leivant and O’Donnell, and Phillips) have questioned the adequacy of Peano arithmetic for computer science. This uncertainty has only been increased by the recent work of Paris and Harrington showing that certain simple, finitistic, combinatorial statements are in fact independent of Peano Arithmetic. In this paper we survey complexity theoretic statements that are known to be independent of arithmetic theories. In addition we survey recent results analyzing the arithmetic quantifier structure of computational problems.}

abstract = {In this paper the characteristics and performance are described of a computational process model (CPM) of human way-finding that is based on psychological models of cognition and experimental data on human way-finding. The model comprises two modules, one for representing objectively a suburban environment and the other for representing the cognitive processes involved in navigation. The CPM is employed to simulate and investigate how spatial knowledge that has been acquired and stored is retrieved and processed in order to plan a path to a given goal. The results of the experiments carried out with NAVIGATOR are compared with the results of experiments involving young adults in real environments. We analyze the performance of NAVIGATOR in terms of its ability to find the goal, the amount of time taken to reach a given goal, the differences in performance during way-finding, and the errors in navigation, as a function of several parameters. The parameters are intended to represent key psychological components of human perceptual and cognitive systems and are derived from experimental studies of human way-finding behavior. The main value of this model lies in its use as a device for investigating and understanding human spatial performance, in terms of accurate performance and errors that arise in tasks of way-finding, and the variations among individuals in terms of performance. A set of computational experiments are used to examine the differences in search strategies between ‘individuals’. The effects of various parameters on way-finding performance are analyzed. Errors in way-finding are classified and are compared with Norman’s and Reason’s classification of errors in human performance. The CPM appears to provide a fruitful model for investigating human way-finding behavior.}

abstract = {The effect of leaflet opening angle on flow through a bileaflet mechanical heart valve has been investigated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Steady state, laminar flow for a Newtonian fluid at a Reynolds number of 1500 was used in the two-dimensional model of the valve, ventricle, sinus and aorta. This computational model was verified using one-dimensional laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV). Although marked differences in the flow fields and energy dissipation of the jets downstream of the valve were found between the CFD predictions and the three-dimensional experimental model, both methods showed similar trends in the changes of the flow fields as the leaflet opening angle was altered. As the opening angle increased the area of recirculating fluid downstream of the leaflets, the pressure drop across the valve and the volumetric flow rate through the outer orifice decreased. For opening angles greater than 80° the jet through the outer orifice recombined with the central jet downstream of the leaflet; for an opening angle of 78° the jet through the outer orifice impinged on the aortic wall before recombining with the central jet. This study suggests that the opening angle has a marked effect on the flow downstream of the bileaflet mechanical heart valve and that valves with opening angles greater than 80° are preferable.}

abstract = {Innovative information technology is developing rapidly and is penetrating many areas of life, including education. The paper measures the impact of innovative information technology, using augmented reality (AR) as an example, on the development of creativity and critical thinking among students. The study was conducted among 180 students from Tonghua Normal University in China. The research design: a pre-test and post-test experiment with a control group. The following research findings were obtained: academic knowledge of the experimental group was higher (15.73) than that of the control group (12.13). ARLE model improved critical thinking (8.77 in AR group, 7.60 in the traditional group) and creativity (593 in AR group, 570 in the traditional group). The resulting data demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model of learning with the augmented reality technology. The research findings have practical implications. For example, they may be used to create new augmented reality apps for other disciplines and majors. The study presents recommendations on the development of creative and critical thinking, which teachers of various disciplines can apply in practice. The impact of other digital tools in education needs to be carefully studied to determine their effectiveness.}

abstract = {This research article aims to describe how the confluence of financial economics, mathematics and computational technologies can prove to be so effective in the practice of financial engineering. As per modern demands, financial derivatives constitute a vast and rapidly growing portion of the global financial markets. The tool is being used exponentially in portfolio management and for hedging purposes and thus, strong efforts have been projected on modelling of derivative products. In addition, this research article also addresses one of the major problems of pricing European plain vanilla options namely the constant volatility assumption of the Black-Scholes model concentrating the volatility of the underlying assets. Since pricing bias emerges as the most dominant feature of Black-Scholes whenever applied with options and this is the main cause why Black-Scholes model is not widely operated upon in pricing of complex non-vanilla options. However, despite the pricing bias problem, amid its simplicity the Black-Scholes framework dominates the pricing of European style options traded on exchanges, since its inception. The issue of eliminating the price bias has already occupied a huge space in previous published literature of this stream, thus instead of focusing on the price bias of Black-Scholes this work is an attempt to resolve and suggest some of the finest solutions of the financial mathematics to overcome this complex problem of option pricing.}

abstract = {Empirical studies of face recognition suggest that faces might be stored in memory by means of a few canonical representations. The nature of these canonical representations is, however, unclear. Although psychological data show a three-quarter-view advantage, physiological studies suggest profile and frontal views are stored in memory. A computational approach to reconcile these findings is proposed. The pattern of results obtained when different views, or combinations of views, are used as the internal representation of a two-stage identification network consisting of an autoassociative memory followed by a radial-basis-function network are compared. Results show that (i) a frontal and a profile view are sufficient to reach the optimal network performance; and (ii) all the different representations produce a three-quarter view advantage, similar to that generally described for human subjects. These results indicate that although three-quarter views yield better recognition than other views, they need not be stored in memory to show this advantage.}

abstract = {Most seabeds are unexplored and rich in mineral deposits, making offshore mining a promising activity. However, offshore operation brings in great challenges from technical equipment to physical space. For instance, an offshore agitated vessel is supposed to stabilize the solids concentration from the underwater mining and make little impact on the stability of the platform or ship. For this reason, we proposed a novel offshore agitated vessel. The whole system based on the arrangement of the mineral processing platform and the slurry mix flow rate is obtained from the previous design stage. Large-scale unsteady computational fluid dynamics simulations are performed to calculate its effectiveness. The simulation model equipped with two pitched blade turbines and inlets/outlets is investigated. A classical Eulerian multiphase model and a modification of the standard k-ε eddy-viscosity turbulence model are adopted to simulate the dense solid–liquid suspension dynamics. Computational fluid dynamics results were found to be in satisfactory agreement with the theoretical predictions. The agitated system obtained was found to be effective to stabilize the solid particle concentration. In order to achieve a higher concentration at outlets and lower power consumption, further improvement was made and validated by computational fluid dynamics simulations. The proposed offshore mechanical agitated vessel could be equipped on offshore mining.}
