abstract = {The two-dimensional Kelvin-Helmholtz instability which arises in two immiscible co-currently moving horizontal liquid layers is studied numerically. Two different methods for capturing the free interface movement are applied, namely the volume-of-fluid method and the level-set method. Both methods are very popular and available within commercial computational fluid dynamics tools. The wave is initialized using two different perturbations implemented into the model. As a case study, a system comprising a toluene layer and an aqueous layer is chosen. Numerical results obtained by both methods are in a good agreement with the linear stability theory for small wave amplitudes. The application of both methods is compared and their advantages and drawbacks are highlighted.}

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the theoretical foundation and implementation of two alternative instructional courses that aimed to support the development of elementary school students’ early algebraic thinking. Both courses approached three basic algebra content strands: generalized arithmetic, functional thinking and modelling languages. The courses differed according to the characteristics of the tasks that were used. The first course involved ‘pure mathematical guided investigations’ emphasizing scaffolding steps in pure mathematics contexts. The second course focused on ‘applied open explorations’ underlining more open questions in applied everyday contexts. The courses were compared in respect to students’ learning outcomes. The findings, yielded from the analysis of pre-test and post-test data, indicated that the second course had better learning outcomes compared to the first.}

abstract = {There has been limited use of ceramic materials for all-ceramic posterior bridges. Major reasons are the low strength, the strength scatter, and the time-dependent strength decrease of ceramics due to slow crack growth. The objective of this study was to predict the long-term failure probability and loading capability of all-ceramic bridges (Empress 1, Empress 2, In-Ceram Alumina, and ZrO2) by computational techniques. The lifetimes of different bridge model designs were predicted by means of the NASA post-processor CARES. Bridges made of zirconia showed a very high mechanical long-term reliability. Empress I and InCeram Alumina seem to be insufficient as posterior bridge materials based on this prediction. The lifetime of the all-ceramic bridges can be significantly increased by improving the design in the connector area. We conclude that computational techniques can help to judge a ceramic material and a specific ceramic bridge design with respect to mechanical reliability before clinical use.}

abstract = {We present a novel computational approach to optimizing the morphological design of robots. Our framework takes as input a parameterized robot design as well as a motion plan consisting of trajectories for end-effectors and, optionally, for its body. The algorithm optimizes the design parameters including link lengths and actuator placements whereas concurrently adjusting motion parameters such as joint trajectories, actuator inputs, and contact forces. Our key insight is that the complex relationship between design and motion parameters can be established via sensitivity analysis if the robot’s movements are modeled as spatiotemporal solutions to an optimal control problem. This relationship between form and function allows us to automatically optimize the robot design based on specifications expressed as a function of actuator forces or trajectories. We evaluate our model by computationally optimizing four simulated robots that employ linear actuators, four-bar linkages, or rotary servos. We further validate our framework by optimizing the design of two small quadruped robots and testing their performances using hardware implementations.}

abstract = {Interstitial photodynamic therapy has shown promising results in the treatment of locally advanced head and neck cancer. In this therapy, systemic administration of a light-sensitive drug is followed by insertion of multiple laser fibers to illuminate the tumor and its margins. Image-based pretreatment planning is employed in order to deliver a sufficient light dose to the complex locally advanced head-and-neck cancer anatomy, in order to meet clinical requirements. Unfortunately, the tumor may deform between pretreatment imaging for the purpose of planning and intraoperative imaging when the plan is executed. Tumor deformation may result from the mechanical forces applied by the light fibers and variation of the patient’s posture. Pretreatment planning is frequently done with the assistance of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging in an outpatient suite, while treatment monitoring and control typically uses ultrasound imaging due to considerations of costs and availability in the operation room. This article presents a computational method designed to bridge the gap between the 2 imaging events by taking a tumor geometry, reconstructed during preplanning, and by following the displacement of fiducial markers, which are initially placed during the preplanning procedure. The deformed tumor shape is predicted by solving an inverse problem, seeking for the forces that would have resulted in the corresponding fiducial marker displacements. The computational method is studied on spheres of variable sizes and demonstrated on computed tomography reconstructed locally advanced head and neck cancer model. Results of this study demonstrate an average error of less than 1 mm in predicting the deformed tumor shape, where 1 mm is typically the order of uncertainty in distance measurements using magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography imaging and high-quality ultrasound imaging. This study further demonstrates that the deformed shape can be calculated in a few seconds, making the proposed method clinically relevant.}

abstract = {We present a computational model of learned avoidance behavior in a one-way avoidance experiment. Our model employs the reinforcement learning paradigm and a temporal-difference algorithm to implement both classically conditioned and instrumentally conditioned components. The role of the classically conditioned component is to develop an expectation of future benefit that is a function of the learning system’s state and action. Competition among the instrumentally conditioned components determines the overt behavior generated by the learning system. Our model displays, in simulation, the reduced latency of the avoidance behavior during learning with continuing trials and the resistance to extinction of the avoidance response. These results are consistent with experimentally observed animal behavior. Our model extends the traditional two-process learning mechanism of Mowrer by explicitly defining the mechanisms of proprioceptive feedback, an internal clock, and generalization over the action space.}

abstract = {John Pollock (1940–2009) was an influential American philosopher who made important contributions to various fields, including epistemology and cognitive science. In the last 25 years of his life, he also contributed to the computational study of defeasible reasoning and practical cognition in artificial intelligence. He developed one of the first formal systems for argumentation-based inference and he put many issues on the research agenda that are still relevant for the argumentation community today. This paper presents an appreciation of Pollock’s work on defeasible reasoning and its relevance for the computational study of argument. In our opinion, Pollock deserves to be remembered as one of the founding fathers of the field of computational argument, while, moreover, his work contains important lessons for current research in this field, reminding us of the richness of its object of study.}

This article is an effort to contribute to the slowly growing literature concerning the replication of agent-based computational models. We present a replication of Kollman, Miller, and Page’s model of Tiebout sorting. In that model, individual agents with heterogeneous preferences for government policies select among jurisdictions that offer the most satisfactory package of government services. This project makes three contributions to the literature. First, our successful replication provides the research community with a modernized version of that seminal model. Second, we confirm that earlier results with respect to the single jurisdiction setting are highly robust with respect to voter preferences, while the results for multiple jurisdiction settings are more sensitive. Finally, we demonstrate a technique for conducting sensitivity analyses that leverages a high-dimensional experimental design.}

abstract = {This workshop addressed current issues with regard to establishing a framework for the validation of quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSARs) and other computational prediction models. QSARs and related models attempt to associate physicochemical and structural properties of compounds to their biological activity. As such, they may permit the prediction of biological activity from chemical structure alone. As yet, no formal validation criteria have been agreed internationally for QSARs and related techniques. However, some general and preliminary criteria were discussed and agreed upon at a European Chemical Industry Council/International Council of Chemical Associations (CEFIC/ICCA) workshop on the regulatory acceptance of QSARs, held in Setubal, Portugal, in March 2002. These criteria were presented at a Fourth World Congress workshop, along with a proposal for the practical validation of computer models, such as QSARs.}
