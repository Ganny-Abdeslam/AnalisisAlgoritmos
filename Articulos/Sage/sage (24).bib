abstract = {The substantial volume, continued growth, and resulting complexity of the scientific literature not only increases the need for systematic, replicable, and rigorous literature reviews, but also highlights the natural limits of human researchers’ information processing capabilities. In search of a solution to this dilemma, computational techniques are beginning to support human researchers in synthesizing large bodies of literature. However, actionable methodological guidance on how to design, conduct, and document such computationally augmented literature reviews is lacking to date. We respond by introducing and defining computational literature reviews (CLRs) as a new review method and put forward a six-step roadmap, covering the CLR process from identifying the review objectives to selecting algorithms and reporting findings. We make the CLR method accessible to novice and expert users alike by identifying critical design decisions and typical challenges for each step and provide practical guidelines for tailoring the CLR method to four conceptual review goals. As such, we present CLRs as a literature review method where the choice, design, and implementation of a CLR are guided by specific review objectives, methodological capabilities, and resource constraints of the human researcher.}

abstract = {Abstract A survey of the main challenges in computational aeroelasticity is presented and recent ideas and developments are discussed. Advances over the past 25 years have to a large extent been paced by the required developments in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The fluid-structure coupling problem remains of central importance and must be addressed in a rational manner in order to obtain accurate and reliable flutter solutions. In the direct Eulerian-Lagrangian computational scheme, a consistent and efficient fluid-structure coupling is obtained by modelling and integrating the fluid-structure system as a single dynamical system, without introducing normal or assumed modes, or an artificial “virtual surface” at the boundary. This computational approach effectively eliminates the phase integration errors associated with classical methods, where the fluid and the structure are integrated sequentially using different schemes. Numerical results are presented to contrast the efficacy of the various schemes in non-linear aeroelastic and aeroservoelastic calculations.}

The results reinforce contingency theory and suggest particular characteristics of different project environments that make one form relatively more or less appropriate than another. Practically, the answers to the research questions have direct and immediate application to project/portfolio managers and senior executives. Theoretically, broad classes of organizations are generalized and prescribe a novel set of organizational design guides.}

abstract = {In this dialogue, Phillip Howard introduces “computational propaganda” as an emerging communication tool in political communication and a perspective for investigating misinformation and disinformation. By articulating the concepts, patterns, and mechanisms of computational propaganda, Howard proposes a socio-technical framework for studying computational propaganda. He calls for mixed methods to undertake computational research alongside qualitative investigation, thus addressing the computational as well as the political. Howard emphasizes the battle against algorithm bias, manipulation, and misinformation, and he advocates building an International Panel on the Information Environment (IPIE), an international scientific collaboration, to respond to the challenges. In addition, Howard offers advice on further research in computational propaganda.}

While the hack transcends existing literatures on the digital and informality, it is a distinctive concept and is being used systematically in new domains. I situate the hack conceptually, outline its empirical and methodological value and propose a framework to research the urban hack. Importantly, it is not just the technologies of hacking but the translation of computational logics to the urban that underpins the importance of the hack, as well as the critical need to set out a research agenda surrounding the hack within urban studies.}

In this article, we review a selection of published research regarding computational methods, primarily from systems biology, which support translational research from the molecular level to the bedside, with a focus on applications in trauma and critical care. Trauma is the leading cause of mortality in Americans younger than 45 years, and its rapid progression offers both opportunities and challenges for computational analysis of trends in molecular patterns associated with outcomes and therapeutic interventions. This review presents methods and domain-specific examples that may inspire the development of new algorithms and computational methods that use both molecular and clinical data for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy in disease progression.}

abstract = {In this paper, we propose to use a computational method of chaos control to simulate complex experimental spectra. This computational chaos control technique is based on the Ott–Grebogi–York (OGY) method. We chose the logistic map as the base mathematical model for the development of our work. For the numeric part, we created arbitrary precision algorithms to generate the solutions. This way, we completely eliminated any degradation of chaos from our results. These algorithms were also necessary for the proper perturbation process that the computational chaos control method requires. We control the chaos of the logistic map in two cases of Period 1 and one case of Period 2 to demonstrate that our control method works. The behavior of a complex experimental spectrum was taken and numerically simulated. The simulated spectrum was obtained by controlling the chaos of the logistic map in a variable way with the methods proposed in this work. Our results show that it is possible to simulate very complicated experimental spectra by computationally controlling the chaos of an equation unrelated to the experimental system.}

abstract = {The proliferation of digital data has been the impetus for the emergence of a new discipline for the study of social life: ‘computational social science’. Much research in this field is founded on the premise that society is a complex system with emergent structures that can be modeled or reconstructed through digital data. This paper suggests that computational social science serves practical and legitimizing functions for digital capitalism in much the same way that neoclassical economics does for neoliberalism. In recognition of this homology, this paper develops a critique of the complexity perspective of computational social science and argues for a heterodox computational social science founded on the meta-theory of critical realism that is critical, methodological pluralist, interpretative and explanative. This implies diverting computational social science’ computational methods and digital data so as to not be aimed at identifying invariant laws of social life, or optimizing state and corporate practices, but to instead be used as part of broader research strategies to identify contingent patterns, develop conjunctural explanations, and propose qualitatively different ways of organizing social life.}

abstract = {Robotics education has gradually been emphasized in contemporary school curricula; however, assessment tools for robotics learning are still limited. Based on Bloom’s Taxonomy of educational objectives, this study aimed to develop the Robotics Learning Self-Efficacy Scale (RLSES) with a two-level construct of five dimensions for assessing students’ self-efficacy for learning robotics. A total of 181 elementary, junior high and senior high school students (5th–12th graders) with robotics learning experience were selected as the sample of this study. A questionnaire including 32 candidate items designed for the initial version of the RLSES was administered to the sample. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted and, finally, 16 items were drawn for the final RLSES under five subscales (Comprehension, Practice, Analysis, Application, and Collaboration), with a total explained variance of 85.28%. The Cronbach’s alpha reliability was .97 for the overall scale, ranging from .87 to .95 for the subscales. The inter-correlation analysis showed evidence of discriminant validity. Regression analysis results supported that Practice and Comprehension self-efficacy were significant predictors of Analysis, Application, and Collaboration self-efficacy, confirming the two-level (2 × 3) construct of the RLSES. Significant differences among school levels were found and are discussed.}
