abstract = {Cancer is a complex disease characterized by a wide array of mutually interacting components constituting the tumor microenvironment (connective tissue, vascular system, immune cells), many of which are targeted therapeutically. In particular, immune checkpoint inhibitors have recently become an established part of the treatment of cancer. Despite great promise, only a portion of the patients display durable response. Current research efforts are concentrated on the determination of tumor-specific biomarkers predictive of response, such as tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, and neo-antigen presentation. However, it is clear that several additional characteristics pertaining to the tumor microenvironment play a critical role in the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Here we comment on the computational methods that are used for the analysis of the tumor microenvironment components from transcriptomic data, discuss the critical needs, and foresee potential evolutions in the field.}

abstract = {Pultrusion is a continuous manufacturing process used to produce high strength composite profiles with constant cross section. The mutual interactions between heat transfer, resin flow and cure reaction, variation in the material properties, and stress/distortion evolutions strongly affect the process dynamics together with the mechanical properties and the geometrical precision of the final product. In the present work, pultrusion process simulations are performed for a unidirectional (UD) graphite/epoxy composite rod including several processing physics, such as fluid flow, heat transfer, chemical reaction, and solid mechanics. The pressure increase and the resin flow at the tapered inlet of the die are calculated by means of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) finite volume model. Several models, based on different homogenization levels and solution schemes, are proposed and compared for the evaluation of the temperature and the degree of cure distributions inside the heating die and at the postdie region. The transient stresses, distortions, and pull force are predicted using a sequentially coupled three-dimensional (3D) thermochemical analysis together with a 2D plane strain mechanical analysis using the finite element method and compared with results obtained from a semianalytical approach.}

abstract = {Abstract The development of intimal hyperplasia at arterial bypass graft anastomoses is a major factor responsible for graft failure. A revised surgical technique, involving the incorporation of a small section of vein (vein cuff) into the distal anastomosis of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts, alters the distribution of intimal hyperplasia and improves graft performance. Numerical and in vitro flow visualization experiments have been conducted to identify the flow behaviour in the cuffed bypass model and to determine whether the improved performance of the cuffed system can be accounted for by haemodynamic factors. The flowfield at the cuffed anastomosis is characterized by an expansive recirculation. Separation occurs at the graft heel, and at the cuff toe as the blood enters the recipient artery. Wall shear stresses in the vicinity of the cuff heel are low, but high shear stresses and large spatial gradients in the shearing force act for a time on the artery floor. In the conventional model, a less disturbed flow prevails while the gradients of shear stress on the floor are smaller. Aspects of the anastomotic haemodynamics are worsened when the cuff is employed. The superior patency rates of cuffed bypasses may not be explained purely on the basis of local haemodynamic factors.}

abstract = {In order to improve the correctness and efficiency of fault diagnosis, a novel hybrid intelligence method based on integrating rough set, genetic algorithms, and radial basic function neural network (RGRN) was proposed for motor fault diagnosis in the complicated CNC system in this article. In the proposed RGRN method, combination and condition supplement algorithm was used to deal with the incomplete fault data and the original data were discretized using genetic algorithms to construct a decision table. Rough set theory as a new mathematical tool was used to eliminate the redundant and irrelevant attributes in order to obtain the minimum rule set for reducing the number of input nodes of the radial basic function neural network. Genetic algorithms were directly used to optimize the structure and weights of radial basic function neural network to establish an optimized radial basic function neural network (GRN) model; then, the minimum rule set was inputted into the GRN model in order to obtain the optimized RGRN model. Finally, the completed fault symptom information was inputted into the RGRN model to obtain the fault diagnosis results. The robustness of the RGRN method was tested. Simulating experiments on motor fault diagnosis in the complicated CNC system show the RGRN method not only improves the global optimization performance and quickens the convergence speed, but also obtains the robust solution with a better quality.}

abstract = {Why do some individuals pick up arms as opposed to others who live under the same conditions? Environmental and group theories fail to differentiate between these individuals. In response, we apply the cognitive mapping approach and model violence as decisions based on chains of beliefs about various types of factors, including state aggression, access to violent groups, religion, and personal characteristics. Based on a double-paired comparison, data are constructed from ethnographic interviews with Muslim and non-Muslim individuals engaging in violent and nonviolent activity in authoritarian and democratic states—Egypt and Germany. The analysis develops a computational model formalizing the cognitive maps into Bayesian networks. In 477,604 runs, the model (1) identifies the beliefs connected to decisions, (2) traces inference chains antecedent to decisions, and (3) explores counterfactuals. This suggests that both violent and nonviolent activities are responses to state aggression, and not to Islam, group access, or personal characteristics.}

abstract = {Abstract In this paper, experiments were carried out on a direct-injection diesel engine using a common-rail system, in order to study the effects of multi-injection modes on the combustion characteristics and pollutant emissions. A soot model was proposed for the post-injection mode, namely the Hiroyasu—Kodota averaged-reaction-rate soot model, which took into account both the chemical kinetics reaction and the turbulent mixing motion of the spray jet. Through integrating the revised soot model into a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, the combustion process and pollutants formation of the tested engine were simulated. The in-cylinder gas pressure and combustion heat release rate showed satisfactory agreement with measurements. The experimental data demonstrated that the pilot-injection mode was one of the most effective measures for reducing combustion noise. Meanwhile an optimum split-injection mode consisting of an appropriate pilot-injection fuel quantity combined with an optimal pilot-injection—main-injection interval could be achieved to decrease the nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission while not causing the particulate matter (PM) emission to deteriorate very much. Two innovative concepts of an active thermo-atmosphere and a passive inert atmosphere were presented from numerical simulation to discuss the effect of the pilot-injection mode on the combustion behaviour of the main injection. Regarding the post-injection mode, its prominent advantage was to decrease significantly the PM emission without an NOx emission penalty. Furthermore, by CFD modelling of the soot formation process, it can be observed that the turbulent mixing motion caused by the post-injection spray played a vital role in the soot oxidization process.}

abstract = {Design modification is a main step in developing machines and artificial organ. A new dialysis apparatus air chamber detects clot formation and interruption of blood refining circuit. Due to using enough anticoagulant, thrombosis may occur because of vortex formed by turbulent flow. Turbulent blood flow causes to endothelial injury thus supporting the formation of a thrombus. Computational fluid dynamics can estimate the flow velocity and turbulence distribution and it can be used as applicable tool to design diagnosis and modifying. In this paper CFD simulation used to find the high turbulent intensity region within the chamber and an optimization method is adopted based on the geometry changing and trying the simulation results. The turbulent intensity is chosen as a criterion to achieving to an optimized condition. Finally, a best geometry is derived for the chamber entrance by this process and modified prototype is manufactured. This refined chamber maintains on the dialysis machine and tested for several patients with different blood characteristics. The results show that no more clot formation has been observed in this new designed chamber.}

abstract = {Human, social, and international conflicts are inescapable facts of life. This article elaborates on how advances in simulation theory and methodology can improve exploring and studying the dynamics of conflicts. The premise of the proposed strategy is based on the observation that agent-based social simulation, which enables high-level and powerful problem-solving capabilities, needs to be significantly enhanced to model complex, multilevel, and multistaged conflicts. To this end, the issues, challenges, and rationale underlying a novel simulation methodology, called multisimulation, are explained. The conceptual foundations needed for the realization of multisimulation are presented to contribute to the development of advanced simulation-based computational laboratories for conflict studies. Finally, by using the Bloomfield-Leiss dynamic phase model of conflict, the author argues for the utility of multisimulation.}

abstract = {The blood pump is an implantable device with strict performance requirements. Any effective structural improvement will help to improve the treatment of patients. However, the research of blood pump structure improvement is a complex optimization problem with multiple parameters and objectives. This study takes the splitter blade as the object of structural improvement. Computational fluid mechanics and neural networks are combined in research and optimization. And hydraulic experiments and micro particle image velocimetry technology were used. In the optimization study, the number of blades, axial length and circumferential offset are optimization parameters, and hydraulic performance and hemolytic prediction index are optimization targets. The study analyzes the influence of each parameter on performance and completes the optimization of the parameters. In the results, the optimal parameters of number of blades, axial length ratio, and circumferential offset are 2.6° and 0.41°, respectively. Under optimized parameters, hydraulic performance can be significantly improved. And the results of hemolysis prediction and micro particle image velocimetry experiments reflect that there is no increase in the risk of hemolytic damage. The results of this study provide a method and ideas for improving the structure of the axial spiral blade blood pump. The established optimization method can be effectively applied to the design and research of axial spiral blade blood pumps with complex, high precision, and multiple parameters and targets.}

abstract = {The serious geological hazards occurred frequently in the last few years. They have inflicted heavy casualties and property losses. Hence, it is necessary to design a geological information service system to analyze and evaluate geological hazards. With the development of computer and Internet service model, it is now possible to obtain rich data and process the data with some advanced computing techniques under network environment. Then, some technologies, including cyber-physical system, Internet of Things, and cloud computing, have been used in geological information management. Furthermore, the concept of cyber-physical-social-thinking as a broader vision of the Internet of Things was presented through the fusion of those advanced computing technologies. Motivated by it, in this article, a novel modeling and computing method for geological information service system is developed in consideration of the complex data processing requirement of geological service under dynamic environment. Specifically, some key techniques of modeling the information service system and computing geological data via cyber-physical system and Internet of Things are analyzed.
