abstract = {Objective: The aim of present research was to make a Meta-Thinking educational program based on mental-brain simulation and to evaluate its effectiveness on executive functions, emotion regulation and impulsivity in children with ADHD. Methods: The research method was Embedded Design: Embedded Experimental Model. The research sample included 32 children with ADHD who were randomly assigned to two experimental and control groups. The intervention was implemented for eight sessions of 1.5 hr for the experimental group, and fMRI images were taken from them, while the control group didn’t receive any treatment. Finally, using semi-structured interviews, coherent information was collected from the parents of the experimental group about the changes made. Data were analyzed with SPSS-24, MAXQDA, fMRIprep, and FSL software. Results: The Meta-Thinking Educational Program had effect on performance of ADHD children and suppressed brain regions related to DMN. Conclusion: The Implementation of this educational program plays a vital role in improving psychological problems of children with ADHD.}

abstract = {A method and a computational tool oriented to assist the damage and safety evaluation of buildings after strong earthquakes is described in this article. The input of the model is the subjective and incomplete information on the building state, obtained by inspectors which are possibly not expert professionals of the field of building safety. The damage levels of the structural components are usually described by linguistic qualifications which can be adequately processed by computational intelligence techniques based on neuro-fuzzy systems what facilitate the complex and urgent tasks of engineering decision-making on the building occupancy after a seismic disaster. The hybrid neuro-fuzzy system used is based on a special three-layer feedforward artificial neural network and fuzzy rule bases and is an effective tool during the emergency response phase providing decisions about safety, habitability, and reparability of the buildings. Examples of application of the computer program are given for two different building classes.}

abstract = {The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the importance of computational skill for answering items in the Quantitative Thinking subtest (Test Q) of the Iowa Tests of Educational Development (ITED). Nine matched pairs of schools participated in the study. One school from each pair allowed students to use calculators when taking Test Q, while the other school did not allow calculators to be employed. The difficulty levels of the items in Test Q were calculated for both test conditions. In general, the differences in p values were very small. On the basis of these results, it was concluded that computational skill is not a major factor contributing to an examinee’s score on Test Q and thus that the use of Test Q as a measure of problem solving ability is not compromised by its computational requirements.}

abstract = {Abstract A new inverse design method based on non-constant distribution of circulation and axial velocity along the radial direction is used to design a pump impeller and a stator. The radial distribution of axial velocity at the design flowrate is calculated when an empirical radial distribution of circulation is given. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling of the overall performance and the detailed flow field is performed using TASCflow software. A standard k—ɛ turbulence model combined with standard wall functions is used. A frozen rotor approach is employed to simulate the rotor—stator coupling flow field. The overall performances of the water-jet pump and the radial distribution of velocity components at the exit of the impeller are also measured. Good agreement of the overall performance, such as the pressure rise, the power, and the efficiency, between CFD and experiment is obtained. The detailed velocity fields from inviscid analysis, CFD, and experiment are compared and investigated.}

abstract = {The gas-phase structure of protonated β-methylaminoalanine was investigated using infrared multiple photon dissociation spectroscopy in the C–H, N–H, O–H stretching region (2700–3800 cm−1) and the fingerprint region (1000–1900 cm−1). Calculations using density functional theory methods show that the lowest energy structures prefer protonation of the secondary amine. Formation of hydrogen bonds between the primary and secondary amine, and the secondary amine and carboxylic oxygen further stabilize the lowest energy structure. The infrared spectrum of the lowest energy structure originating with harmonic density functional theory has features that generally match the positions of the experimental spectra; however, the overall agreement with the experimental spectrum is poor. Molecular dynamics calculations were used to generate a gas-phase infrared spectrum. With these calculations a reasonable match with the experimental spectrum, especially in the high-energy region, was obtained. The results of the molecular dynamics simulation support the density functional theory calculations, with protonation of the secondary amine and the formation of a hydrogen bond between the protonated secondary amine and the primary amine. This work shows the importance of accounting for anharmonic effects in systems with very strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding.}

abstract = {Narrative can be conceptualised as a complex system, with pragmatic benefits for our description of interpretative and affective processes involved in reading. In this article, I show how systemic thinking has shaped many literary theories, and I offer some suggestions about the modelling of narrative as a complex system. Considering the relations between text, reader, and reading situation as constitutive of narrative requires a way of looking at stories keeping in mind that the reader’s experiential background, their cognitive-affective states, and the situational context all play a crucial role in the emergence of what we call a narrative. Here I suggest that Transformer-based language models can be considered artificial systems that simulate a (disembodied) reading process and make it possible to model narrative as a complex system, including the encoded experiential background of the (simulated) reader.}

abstract = {This study investigated the computational cost associated with grammatical planning in sentence production. We measured people’s pupillary responses as they produced spoken descriptions of depicted events. We manipulated the syntactic structure of the target by training subjects to use different types of sentences following a colour cue. The results showed higher increase in pupil size for the production of passive and object dislocated sentences than for active canonical subject–verb–object sentences, indicating that more cognitive effort is associated with more complex noncanonical thematic order. We also manipulated the time at which the cue that triggered structure-building processes was presented. Differential increase in pupil diameter for more complex sentences was shown to rise earlier as the colour cue was presented earlier, suggesting that the observed pupillary changes are due to differential demands in relatively independent structure-building processes during grammatical planning. Task-evoked pupillary responses provide a reliable measure to study the cognitive processes involved in sentence production.}

abstract = {We analyze and compare three different computational methods for a solar heating system with seasonal water tank heat storage (SHS-SWTHS). These methods are accurate numerical method, temperature stratification method, and uniform temperature method. The accurate numerical method can accurately predict the performance of the system, but it takes about 4 to 5 weeks, which is too long and hard for the performance analysis of this system. The temperature stratification method obtains relatively accurate computation results and takes a relatively short computation time, which is about 2 to 3 hours. Therefore, this method is most suitable for the performance analysis of this system. The deviation of the computational results of the uniform temperature method is great, and the time consumed is similar to that of the temperature stratification method. Therefore, this method is not recommended herein. Based on the above analyses, the temperature stratification method is applied to analyze the influence of the embedded depth of water tank, the thickness of thermal insulation material, and the collection area on the performance of this system. The results will provide a design basis for the related demonstration projects.}
