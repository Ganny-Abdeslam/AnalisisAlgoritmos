abstract = {In this response to Ambrose, VanTassel-Baska, Coleman, and Cross’s (2010) thought-provoking article on the nature and state of the field of gifted education, the author first discusses the role of disciplinary knowledge in his field. He argues that gifted education, as a normative and practical endeavor (i.e., a profession), is different from academic disciplines in research agendas and that technical rationality is not sufficient for identifying its “best practice.” The author then suggests a “flat” structure to facilitate close collaboration between theorists, researchers, and practitioners in tackling pressing problems and fashioning innovative practices. To facilitate discussion of explorations in our practice, he delineates three basic service models or paradigms in gifted education as follows: the gifted child paradigm, the talent development paradigm, and the differentiation paradigm. He proposes five criteria for assessing their strengths and potential weaknesses. Finally, he suggests that the best way of providing evidence-based best practice is through use-inspired, design studies, which not only address the question of whether a practical model works but also specify goals, assumptions, resources, processes, and constraints involved so that “how it works” is made transparent.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a prominent topic in K-12 education recently. However, pedagogical design has remained a major challenge, especially among young learners. Guided by the Zone of Proximal Development theory and AI education research literature, this design-based study proposes an analogy-based pedagogical approach to support AI teaching and learning in upper primary education. This pedagogical approach is centered on human–AI comparison, where humans are gradually shifted from an analogue to a contrast to make visible the attributes, mechanisms, and processes of AI. To evaluate its effectiveness, a quasi-experimental study with mixed methods was conducted. The quantitative comparison shows that the participants in the experimental group learning with the analogy-based pedagogical approach significantly outperformed their peers with the conventional direct instructional approach in all three dimensions of AI knowledge, skills, and ethical awareness. Qualitative analyses further reveal its pedagogical benefits, including demystifying AI through relatable and engaging learning, supporting student comprehension and skill mastery, and nurturing critical thinking and attitudes. The analogy-based approach contributes to the field of K-12 AI education with an age-appropriate, child-friendly pedagogical approach. Notably, AI education should prioritize teaching for student understanding, and AI should be recognized as an independent subject with interdisciplinary applications.}

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the correlational and causal relationship between middle school students’ entrepreneurial competencies and science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) attitudes. A total of 648 middle school students (seventh and eighth grade) participated in this study. STEM attitude scale and two entrepreneurial competency scales that were developed in different studies in the literature were used as data collection tools. In addition, a simple regression, a multiple regression and a stepwise multiple regression analysis were executed to analyse the data. The correlational analysis showed that there was a moderate level, positive correlation between the STEM attitudes of students and their overall entrepreneurial competencies. Also, the multiple regression analysis showed that entrepreneurial competencies consisting of professionalism, risk-taking, creativity and tenacity explained 41% of the change in STEM attitude. The stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that professionalism predicted the most the STEM attitude statistically more.}

abstract = {Scientists can reason about natural systems, including the mind and brain, in many ways, with each form of reasoning being associated with its own set of limitations. The limitations on human reasoning imply that the process of reasoning about theories and communicating those theories will be error prone; we must therefore be concerned about the reproducibility of theories whose very nature is shaped by constraints on human reasoning. The problem of reproducibility can be alleviated by computational modeling, which maximizes correspondence between the actual behavior of a posited system and its behavior inferred through reasoning and increases the fidelity of communication of our theories to others.}

abstract = {This intervention advances glitches as epistemological vectors for apprehending and engaging the significance of digitally-mediated spatialities that appear nonperformative against normative scripts of urban computational paradigms. Drawing on two strands of contemporary thinking about glitches as systemic design features of digital systems and as generative fissures within them, we mobilize a queer orientation that stays with the generative tensions of urban spatialities that present as idiosyncratic and as interrupting. We mobilize this epistemological approach through illustrative U.S. based examples of seemingly abandoned shared e-bikes, performatively ‘ugly’ homes, and wilful property dilapidation wrought through the registers of desire and aesthetics. In so doing, we show how glitch empistemologies render visible how the technocapitalist manufacturing of normative spatial desires for particular kinds of urban sociospatialities and aesthetic visual signatures are both secured and interrupted on digitally-mediated and -mediatized terrains. Glitch epistemologies establish the significance of small-scale disorientations in digital urban mediations, engaging these nonperformativities and non-computes as unexceptional openings onto everyday possibilities for politics in computational cities.}

abstract = {The University of Florida Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering recently created a new senior technical elective in the field of computational fluid dynamics. The main objectives of the class are learning the process of computational fluid dynamics, skepticism, a course project that uses a popular commercial solver, and a course project that involves programming a simplified computational fluid dynamics code. The course covers introductory material, history, grid generation, numerics, equations of motion, boundary conditions, solvers, turbulence models, visualization, and a number of special topics. Skepticism is enforced throughout the course and forces students to justify the validity of their approach and question numerically generated results. Students in the class undertake a course project to predict a fundamental flow-field and compare predictions with excellent measurements from the open literature. They must also create a simplified computational fluid dynamics code to predict turbulent boundary layer flow. Students have integrated these lessons within student groups across the University of Florida. The emphasis of the course is on skepticism and increasing integration with the curriculum and student group activities. We present the class philosophy for teaching undergraduate computational fluid dynamics and the outcomes of the newly developed course.}

abstract = {The use of a pedagogical approach mediated transfer with the bridging method has been successful in facilitating the transitions from block-based to text-based programming languages. Nevertheless, there is a lack of research addressing the impact of this transfer on programming misconceptions during the transition. The way programming concepts are taught to K-12 learners can later result in misconceptions for adult learners. The main objective was to examine the impact of mediated transfer using the bridging method pedagogical approach on the prevalence of programming misconceptions. We conducted a quasi-experimental study in school settings during informatics (computer science) classes among 163 sixth-grade students. The control group received traditional programming lectures using the text-based programming language, Python. Conversely, the experimental group utilized a mediated transfer pedagogical approach by starting with the block-based programming language MakeCode for micro:bit before transitioning to the text-based Python. Our findings indicate that the experimental group significantly reduced programming misconceptions in fundamental programming concepts: variables, sequencing, selection, and loops - compared to the control group. This suggests that the use of block-based programming language as an initial step in programming education, followed by a structured transition to text-based programming language, can effectively mitigate common misconceptions among K-12 learners.}

abstract = {Computer-based design and fabrication systems in architecture contain modes of operation and preferences that often constrain tectonic possibilities in design and construction. These predispositions neglect architecture’s cultural and material dimensions, resulting in universalizing tectonics that erase nuances of place, culture, and expression in design. How may we celebrate local tectonic languages while also revisiting them through computer-based systems in architecture? The project examined here highlights novel possibilities for cultural expression and craftsmanship through computational design methods, retaining the expressive potential of a local craft while de-familiarizing its cultural context. I analyze how shape grammars and digital fabrication methods deployed in design, de-familiarizes the craft of wire-bending in costuming in the Trinidad Carnival. I present and apply new rules for the craft’s computational description based on material tests and an architectural application to expand discourses on critical regionalism. I adopt Tabbarah’s term “computational regionalism” to describe this process and elaborate it as a five-step sequence. Computational regionalism employs computational methods to translate local craft knowledge and tectonic languages into new interpretations and poetics of construction. Its process of creative de-familiarization raises critical questions about the local and the universal.}
