abstract = {Abstract An overview over flamelet modelling for turbulent non-premixed combustion is given. A short review of previous contributions to simulations of direct injection (DI) diesel engine combustion using the representative interactive flamelet concept is presented. A surrogate fuel consisting of 70 per cent (liquid volume) n-decane and 30 per cent α-methyl-naphthalene is experimentally compared to real diesel fuel. The resemblance of their physical and chemical properties is shown to result in very similar combustion and pollutant formation for both fuels. In order to account for variations of the scalar dissipation rate within the computational domain, a method using multiple flamelets, called the Eulerian particle flamelet model, is used. A strategy is described for subdividing the computational domain and assigning the resulting subdomains to different flamelet histories represented by Eulerian marker particles. Experiments conducted with an Audi DI diesel engine and diesel fuel are compared to simulations using the surrogate fuel. The use of multiple flamelets, each having a different history, significantly improves the description of the ignition phase, leading to a better prediction of pressure, heat release and exhaust emissions of soot and NOx. The effect of the number of flamelet particles on the predictions is discussed.}

abstract = {In the current review, an exceptional view on the multi-scale integrated computational modelling and data-driven methods in the Additive manufacturing (AM) of metallic materials in the framework of integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) is discussed. In the first part of the review, process simulation (P-S linkage), structure modelling (S-P linkage), property simulation (S-P linkage), and integrated modelling (PSP and PSPP linkages) are elaborated considering different physical phenomena (multi-physics) in AM and at micro/meso/macro scales (multi-scale modelling). The second part provides an extensive discussion of a data-driven framework, which involves extracting existing data from databases and texts, data pre-processing, high throughput screening, and, therefore, database construction. A data-driven workflow that integrates statistical methods, including ML, artificial intelligence (AI), and neural network (NN) models, has great potential for completing PSPP linkages. This review paper provides an insight for both academic and industrial researchers, working on the AM of metallic materials.}

abstract = {One advantage of highly automated vehicles is drivers can use commute time for non-driving tasks, such as work-related tasks. The potential for an auto-mobile office—a space where drivers work in automated vehicles—is a complex yet underexplored idea. This paper begins to define a design space of the auto- mobile office in SAE Level 3 automated vehicles by integrating the affinity diagram (AD) with a computational representation of the abstraction hierarchy (AH). The AD uses a bottom-up approach where researchers starting with individual findings aggregate and abstract those into higher-level concepts. The AH uses a top-down approach where researchers start with first principles to identify means-ends links between system goals and concrete forms of the system. Using the programming language R, the means-ends links of AH can be explored statistically. This computational approach to the AH provides a systematic means to define the design space of the auto-mobile office.}

abstract = {Snow-drifting disasters frequently occur in snowy regions with strong winds and can cause traffic interruptions. Cuttings are particularly vulnerable to severe snowdrift disasters, making designing cutting sections in regions prone to drifting snow challenging. To address this issue, a series of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted to study the impact of cutting section parameters on snowdrift development in cuttings with varying depths and slopes. Initially, the wind velocity and wall friction velocity were carefully analyzed in the initial state of the cutting. The evolution process of snow distribution in different cuttings was then compared. Furthermore, the influence of parameters on wind velocity development was analyzed. Based on the flow patterns and snow distribution, cuttings involved in drifting snow disasters can be divided into two types, depending on whether there are vortices in the cutting. When the slope gradient changes from 1/1 to 1/2, the flow in the cutting will not separate and reattach, indicating that the critical slope angle for two types of cutting is 27°. As the slope gradient decreases, the leeward drift will move from the area near the crest to the foot of the slope. Increasing the depth of the cutting not only reduces the accumulation of snow on the road surface but also provides scope to improve the safety reserve capacity of the slopes.}

abstract = {A review of some of the 35 + studies applying Kauffman’s NK model to an administrative context unquestioningly presume that groupthink predominates—a misrepresentation of reality in many firms. Groupthink results from strong ties (contacts); novelty and entrepreneurship results from weak ties. The biological basis of the NK model leads to groupthink. But employees don’t usually behave like genes. Recent findings in the strong-tie/weak-tie literature are presented, leading up to the notion of a tipping point. But, how many weak-ties does a firm need before its overall behavior tips from groupthink to innovation? The NK model is changed in just one way so that it produces results showing the transition from strong- to weak-tie situations. The one change introduces F, the number of contacts per year; it varies from once a week to once a year. How “weak” do ties have to become before novelty effects result? Our results clearly show that the “F” variable negates the standard NK effect of emergent “complexity catastrophe,” which is a dramatic loss of overall fitness. And, yes, there is a tipping point.}

abstract = {Documents have been increasingly recognised as important objects of investigation in Science and Technology Studies (STS); however, so far, much less attention has been given to the study of documents produced in Digital Humanities. The author proposes therefore to use the method of the ‘STS of documents’ and analyse Feasibility documents that aim to assess technical and design requirements based on research questions and to organise a project workflow. Drawing on the ethnography of King’s Digital Lab, the article investigates Feasibility documents produced by the lab within the Agile-based Software Development Lifecycle framework. The article aims to show that Feasibility documents (1) inform ethnographic work about lab workflow and management and in doing so, are able to capture the interconnectedness of work layers and practices; (2) enable an empirical analysis of digital research projects and the process of translation from research questions, to methods, to technical solutions; (3) are critical structuring objects that structure the research process and relationships between involved actors and are structured by local institutional strategies and decisions. The author conducts a ‘feasibility analysis’ that reveals the project management and development stages: the analytical process (the translation of research questions into technical solutions); the production process (the move from technical and design practices to research answers) and the infrastructure and management process (project workflow and sustainability solutions). Drawing on Agre’s critical technical practice and Digital Humanities’ theories of critical production, the article seeks to shift attention from end-product digital artefacts towards the complex process of their creation, which can unpack a range of social, technological and management issues. In doing so, it also aims to provide a methodological framework for the analysis of documents produced in Digital Humanities that have the potential to unearth new questions about the socio-technical nature of digital production.}

abstract = {Piaget has distinguished a number of distinct stages in the development of the concept of an enduring external object during infancy. I present a theory of a class of behaviours at one of these stages embodied in a working computer program. The behaviour of this program matches a class of perceptual behaviours of infants between about twelve and twenty weeks of age in a number of experimental situations studied by Bower. The theory argues that these behaviours are a result of the interaction between the perceptual and conceptual levels of the system, and the way in which conflicts between competing descriptions of an object are resolved. I locate the cause of several features of the behaviours in the procedures for managing the changing representation of the world, and the system’s way of treating transitions between the states of an object (for example, moving to stationary). The basic conceptual primitives of the analysis are objects and events, not motion and place, as argued by Bower, or the infant’s previous activity, as argued by Piaget. I argue that adequate explanations of experimental findings such as these require the construction of fairly detailed computational models.}

abstract = {A fast computational method of the aerodynamic characteristics of fan and booster with inlet distortion is developed in this paper. This method is based on a time-marching throughflow model, and the governing equations are circumferentially averaged Navier-Stokes equations. A model of distributed inviscid blade force and viscid blade force is adopted to reproduce the flow deflection and loss. The deviation angle and loss parameters are interpolated from a database which is extracted from 3-D simulation results of compressor with uniform inlet. After a validation case is performed, the aerodynamical performances of a multistage fan and booster with inlet radial and circumferential distortion are computed. The results show the predictive ability of this method, and the acceptable computational time cost indicates the future application potential of this method during the design stage of a new turbomachinery.}
