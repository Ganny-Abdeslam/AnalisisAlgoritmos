abstract = {Cuttings transport from wellbore annulus to the surface via drilling fluids is one of the most important problems in gas and oil industries. In the present paper, the effects of viscoelastic property of drilling fluids on flow through wellbore annulus are studied numerically by use of computational fluid dynamics simulation in OpenFOAM software. This problem is simulated as the flow between two coaxial annulus cylinders and the inner cylinder is rotating through its axes. Here, the Giesekus model is used as the nonlinear constitutive equation. This model brings the nonlinear viscosity, normal stress differences, extensional viscosity and elastic property. The numerical solution is obtained using the second order finite volume method by considering PISO algorithm for pressure correction. The effect of elasticity, Reynolds number, Taylor number and mobility factor on the velocity and stress fields, pressure drop, and important coefficient of drilling mud flow is studied in detail. The results predicted that increasing elastic property of drilling mud lead to an initial sharp drop in the axial pressure gradient as well as Darcy-Weisbach friction coefficient. Increasing the Reynolds number at constant Taylor number, resulted an enhancing in the axial pressure drop of the fluid but Darcy-Weisbach friction coefficient mainly reduced.}

abstract = {This paper discusses the possibility of using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to assess the influence of aerodynamic forces (aerodynamic uplift) on the mean contact force acting between a pantograph and the contact wire. The analysis consists of experimental tests and CFD simulations, performed in both wind tunnel and on-track scenarios. A method for the computation of the aerodynamic uplift and for the assessment of the contact force imbalance between the leading and trailing collectors is proposed. The method is based on the virtual work principle, and exploits both the numerical forces resulting from CFD analysis, and the Jacobian terms obtained from a kinematic analysis of the pantograph. The proposed model takes into account stationary phenomena, and it is fully validated by means of experimental results.}

abstract = {Recent experimental evidence indicates that animals can use mental simulation to make decisions about the actions to take during goal-directed navigation. The principal brain areas found to be active during this process are the hippocampus, the ventral striatum and the sensory-motor cortex. In this paper, we present a computational model that includes biological aspects of this circuit and explains mechanistically how it may be used to imagine and evaluate future events. Its most salient characteristic is that choices about actions are made by simulating movements and their sensory effects using the same brain areas that are active during overt execution. More precisely, the simulation of an action (e.g., walking) creates a new sensory pattern that is evaluated in the same way as real inputs. The model is validated in a navigation task in which a simulated rat is placed in a complex maze. We show that hippocampal and striatal cells are activated to simulate paths, to retrieve their estimated value and to make decisions. We link these results with a general framework that sees the brain as a predictive device that can ‘detach’ itself from the here-and-now of current perception using mechanisms such as episodic memories, motor and visual imagery.}

abstract = {There is a growing interest in organic Rankine cycle turbogenerators because of their ability to efficiently utilize external heat sources at low-to-medium temperature in the small-to-medium power range. High-temperature organic Rankine cycle turbines typically operate at very high pressure ratio and expand the organic working fluid in the dense-vapour thermodynamic region, thus requiring computational fluid dynamics solvers coupled with accurate thermodynamic models for their performance assessment and design. In this article we present a steady-state three-dimensional viscous computational fluid dynamics study of the Tri-O-Gen organic Rankine cycle radial turbine, including the radial nozzle, the rotor and the diffuser. The turbine operates with toluene as the working fluid, whose accurate thermophysical properties are obtained with a look-up table approach. Based on the three-dimensional simulation results, together with a two-dimensional fluid dynamic optimisation procedure documented elsewhere, an improved nozzle geometry is designed, manufactured and experimentally tested. Measurements show it delivers 5 kWe or 4% more net power output, as well as improved off-design performance.}

abstract = {Previous investigators have suggested that the personality variable tolerance for error is related to success in computational estimation. However, this suggestion has not been tested directly. This study examined the relationship between performance on a computational estimation test and scores on the NEO–Five Factor Inventory, a measure of the Big Five personality traits, including Openness, an index of tolerance for ambiguity. Other variables included SAT–I Verbal and Mathematics scores and self-rated mathematics ability. Participants were 65 college students. There was no significant relationship between the tolerance variable and computational estimation performance. There was a modest negative relationship between Agreeableness and estimation performance. The skepticism associated with the negative pole of the Agreeableness dimension may be important to pursue in further understanding of estimation ability.}

abstract = {The wind flow field constitutes an important input parameter for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations that are used in architectural design for the design and analysis of natural ventilation strategies.  Despite indications that the wind flow field may vary between places, CFD simulations that do not adequately account for this potential variation are still commonplace. This may significantly compromise the integrity and accuracy of the CFD simulations. This study was a two-pronged investigation with the ultimate objective of contributing towards efforts aimed at improving the accuracy of the CFD simulations. Firstly, a framework for integrated meso-scale and micro-scale CFD simulations was developed. Secondly, the newly developed framework was then implemented by deploying it to study the variation of the wind flow field between a reference meteorological station, and a selected local building site. The findings confirmed the indications that the wind flow field might vary spatially. The integrated multi-scale framework that was developed as part of the study was not only able to capture the wind flow field variation, but it also provided a way to quantify it, ultimately, leading to the generation of a more accurate wind flow field characterization representative of the local conditions. Through its ability to integrate multiple spatial scales that typically influence one another, this framework can help to enhance the accuracy and integrity of the CFD simulations that are used for natural ventilation design. Practical application: The findings from this study can be particularly useful when undertaking spatially integrated CFD simulations to design and analyse natural ventilation strategies in the building design process.}

abstract = {The overhead multiple outlets ventilation duct system of 18 m long is used to maintain the specified indoor thermal comfort environment for each railway passenger car. Therefore, the flow uniformity of the overhead ventilation duct system is very important for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning performance of a train. In this study, design optimization was conducted to increase the flow uniformity of the overhead ventilation duct system for a train by combining computational fluid dynamics and design of experiment methods. To perform the study, the flow uniformity of the base model was evaluated using numerical analysis whose reliability was verified. Design parameters of the overhead ventilation duct system were selected, and an effectiveness evaluation was performed for each design parameter by using 2k factorial design. Based on the results of the effectiveness evaluation for the design parameters, optimum models having improved flow uniformity were designed using the response surface method. The performances of the optimum models were also evaluated by the same numerical analysis that was applied to the base model. The flow uniformity of the optimum models was improved by controlling the opening ratios of the perforated plates and guide vane shape. In addition, nonuniform flow components locally existing in the base model were suppressed.}

abstract = {This paper reviews recent developments by the Washington/Brown groups for the study of anatomical shape in the emerging new discipline of computational anatomy. Parametric representations of anatomical variation for computational anatomy are reviewed, restricted to the assumption of small deformations. The generation of covariance operators for probabilistic measures of anatomical variation on coordinatized submanifolds is formulated as an empirical procedure. Populations of brains are mapped to common coordinate systems, from which template coordinate systems are constructed which are closest to the population of anatomies in a minimum distance sense. Variation of several one-, two and three-dimensional manifolds, i.e. sulci, surfaces and brain volumes are examined via Gaussian measures with mean and covariances estimated directly from maps of templates to targets. Methods are presented for estimating the covariances of vector fields from a family of empirically generated maps, posed as generalized spectrum estimation indexed over the submanifolds. Covariance estimation is made parametric, analogous to autoregressive modelling, by introducing small deformation linear operators for constraining the spectrum of the fields.}

The commercial computational fluid dynamics code ‘FLUENT’ was used for the numerical simulation of the flow system. A standard k—ε turbulence model was employed for turbulence modelling. The flow field through the impeller was analysed to investigate the effect of blade twists and to determine the forces on the blades. A modified impeller design is suggested whose diameter is less than the existing one, which helps in reducing the centrifugal forces. The flow field analysis of the modified impeller shows improvement in the flow through the impeller channels with better performance and reduction in forces on the blades.}

abstract = {We describe some of the ways that the field of content analysis is being transformed in an Era of Big Data. We argue that content analysis, from its beginning, has been concerned with extracting the main meanings of a text and mapping those meanings onto the space of a textual corpus. In contrast, we suggest that the emergence of new styles of text mining tools is creating an opportunity to develop a different kind of content analysis that we describe as a computational hermeneutics. Here the goal is to go beyond a mapping of the main meaning of a text to mimic the kinds of questions and concerns that have traditionally been the focus of a hermeneutically grounded close reading, a reading that focuses on what Kenneth Burke described as the poetic meanings of a text. We illustrate this approach by referring to our own work concerning the rhetorical character of US National Security Strategy documents.}
