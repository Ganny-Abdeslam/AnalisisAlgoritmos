abstract = {Schizophrenia is an illness with a remarkably complex symptom presentation that has thus far been out of reach of neuroscientific explanation. This presents a fundamental problem for developing better treatments that target specific symptoms or root causes. One promising path forward is the incorporation of computational neuroscience, which provides a way to formalize experimental observations and, in turn, make theoretical predictions for subsequent studies. We review three complementary approaches: (a) biophysically based models developed to test cellular-level and synaptic hypotheses, (b) connectionist models that give insight into large-scale neural-system-level disturbances in schizophrenia, and (c) models that provide a formalism for observations of complex behavioral deficits, such as negative symptoms. We argue that harnessing all of these modeling approaches represents a productive approach for better understanding schizophrenia. We discuss how blending these approaches can allow the field to progress toward a more comprehensive understanding of schizophrenia and its treatment.}

abstract = {In this article, the implementation of the pitch-control option is described within the OpenFOAM computational fluid dynamics library supported by the preliminary results for a few representative test cases. The proposed pitch-control logic represents a simplified version of the typically model available for the load simulation based on blade element momentum theory codes. The control variable for the blade pitch regulation is the rotor rotational speed, for which an additional torque-speed controller determining the equilibrium between the aerodynamic and the electrical torque is required. The simulations are performed on the 80-m-diameter turbine used as a reference design within the SmartBlades project. The unsteady test cases are based on the assumption of rigid, not pre-bend blade, and refer to an emergency stop and an extreme operating gust. Results verified the correctness of the implemented control logic and its sensitivity to the control parameters, that is, the key factors for a successful regulation of power production and load mitigation in wind turbine design. The implemented simulation methodology constitutes the first step toward the reproduction of very complex operating conditions for wind turbines by means of accurate computations.}

abstract = {CFD (Computational fluid dynamics) is a tool, through which, the entire combustion process for pulverized coal combustion (PCC) can be predicted. The solid fuel combustion modeling is not as simple as gaseous or liquid fuel combustion modeling. In the solid fuel combustion process, various physical transformations and chemical reactions occur simultaneously. Therefore in the computational modeling approach for PCC, basic physical and chemical processes such as; turbulence, radiation, devolatilization, gas-phase combustion, char reaction and soot formation/reduction are integrated to obtain the desired results. However, in order to reach the desired accuracy, different computational models should be chosen carefully. In this review, various common models that are widely used in PCC simulation are discussed scientifically along with their modeling aspects. The basic advantages and disadvantages of these models are also discussed in this study. Moreover, different models preferred by various authors for pulverized coal combustion simulation process are also summarized. From the review, it has been observed that the eddy viscosity based two-equation turbulent models and Eulerian-Lagrangian multiphase approach are mostly preferred due to better computational economy. Two competing rate devolatilization model from various finite rate models and FG-DVC devolatilization model from various phenomenological models are mostly used for PCC. Diffusion kinetic control and Intrinsic char combustion models are mostly chosen to predict the char reaction. Finite reaction rate models are preferred when the computational economy is a concern, whereas phenomenological models provide results with better accuracy because in phenomenological models realistic inputs are given as input for simulation whereas, in finite rate models, finite rate constants are mostly empirical. Most of the gas phase models are given almost equal importance. Discrete ordinate (DO) is mostly used for PCC due to its ability of volumetric radiation calculation and the ability to evaluate radiation effect on the particle phase.}

abstract = {Several studies based on in vivo or in vitro models have found promising results for the noble gas argon in neuroprotection against ischaemic pathologies. The development of argon as a medicinal product includes the requirement for toxicity testing through non-clinical studies. The long exposure period of animals (rats) during several days results in technical and logistic challenges related to the gas administration. In particular, a minimum of 10 air changes per hour (ACH) to maintain animal welfare results in extremely large volumes of experimental gas required if the gas is not recirculated. The difficulty with handling the many cylinders prompted the development of such a recirculation-based design. To distribute the recirculating gas to individually ventilated cages and monitor them properly was deemed more difficult than constructing a single large enclosure that will hold several open cages. To address these concerns, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the preliminary design was performed. A purpose-made exposure chamber was designed based on the CFD simulations. Comparisons of the simulation results to measurements of gas concentration at two cage positions while filling show that the CFD results compare well to these limited experiments. Thus, we believe that the CFD results are representative of the gas distribution throughout the enclosure. The CFD shows that the design provides better gas distribution (i.e. a higher effective air change rate) than predicted by 10 ACH.}

abstract = {It is often claimed that computational methods for examining textual data give good enough party position estimates at a fraction of the costs of many non-computational methods. However, the conclusive testing of these claims is still far from fully accomplished. We compare the performance of two computational methods, Wordscores and Wordfish, and four non-computational methods in estimating the political positions of parties in two dimensions, a left-right dimension and a progressive-conservative dimension. Our data comprise electoral party manifestos written in Finnish and published in Finland. The non-computational estimates are composed of the Chapel Hill Expert Survey estimates, the Manifesto Project estimates, estimates deriving from survey-based data on voter perceptions of party positions, and estimates derived from electoral candidates’ replies to voting advice application questions. Unlike Wordfish, Wordscores generates relatively well-performing estimates for many of the party positions, but despite this does not offer an even match to the non-computational methods.}

abstract = {Multiphysics modeling, code development, and validation by full-scale experiments is presented for hydrodynamic/suspension-dynamic interactions of a novel ocean vehicle, the Wave Adaptive Modular Vessel (WAM-V). The boat is a pontoon catamaran with hinged engine pods and elevated payload supported by suspension and articulation systems. Computational fluid dynamics models specific to WAM-V are developed which include hinged pod dynamics, water-jet propulsion modeling, and immersed boundary method for flow in the gap between pontoon and pod. Multi-body dynamics modeling for the suspension and upper-structure dynamic is developed in MATLAB Simulink. Coupled equations of motion are developed and solved iteratively through either one-way or two-way coupling methods to converge on flow-field, pontoon motions, pod motions, waterjet forces, and suspension motions. Validation experiments include cylinder drop with suspended mass and 33-feet WAM-V sea-trials in calm water and waves. Computational results show that two-way coupling is necessary to capture the physics of the interactions. The experimental trends are predicted well and errors are mostly comparable to those for rigid boats, however, in some cases the errors are larger, which is expected due to the complexity of the current studies. Ride quality analyses show that WAM-V suspension is effective in reducing payload vertical accelerations in waves by 73% compared to the same boat with rigid upper-structure.}

abstract = {Building energy simulations coupled with computational fluid dynamics tools have emerged, recently, as an accurate and effective tool to improve the estimation of energy requirements and thermal comfort in buildings. Building modelers and researchers usually implement this coupling in the boundary conditions of both tools (e.g. surface temperature, ambient temperature, and conductive and convective fluxes). This work reviews how the building energy simulation–computational fluid dynamics coupling has evolved since its first implementation to the present day. Moreover, this article also summarizes and discusses the research studies in which the building energy simulation–computational fluid dynamics coupling has been used to analyze building systems, building components, and building urban configurations. Implementing a building energy simulation–computational fluid dynamics coupling brings a series of benefits when compared with the conventional building energy simulation methodology, a building energy simulation–computational fluid dynamics coupling provides an improvement that ranges between 10% and 50% for estimating the building energy requirements. Moreover, the computation time to implement computational fluid dynamics with information obtained from the building energy simulation could be reduced by as well.}

abstract = {In informal argument, an essential step is to ask what will “resonate” with a particular audience and hence persuade. Marketers, for example, may recommend a certain colour for a new soda can because it “pops” on Instagram; politicians may “fine-tune” diction for different social demographics. This paper engages the need to strategise for such resonance by offering a method for automating opposition analysis (OA), a technique from semiotics used in marketing and literary analysis to plot objects of interest on oppositional axes. Central to our computational approach is a reframing of texts as proxies for thought and opposition as the product of oscillation in thought in response to those proxies, a model to which the contextual similarity information contained in word embeddings is relevant. We illustrate our approach with an analysis of texts on gun control from ProCon.org, implementing a three-step method to: 1) identify relatively prominent signifiers; 2) rank possible opposition pairs on prominence and contextual similarity scores; and 3) derive plot values for proxies on opposition pair axes. The results are discussed in terms of strategies for informal argument that might be derived by those on each side of gun control.}
