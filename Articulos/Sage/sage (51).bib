abstract = {Background: Midvault reconstruction is an essential element of functional rhinoplasty. An improved understanding of airflow patterns after spreader graft (SG) or spreader flap (SF) techniques can inform surgical techniques based on individual anatomy. Objectives: The objective of this study was to compare the physiologic changes related to nasal function after midvault reconstruction with SF and SG. Methods: Soft tissue elevation (STE), SG, and SF were performed in sequence on 5 cadaveric specimens. Computational modeling was used to simulate airflow, heat transfer, and humidity in three-dimensional nasal airway reconstructions of each specimen. Results: Median bilateral airflow-rates (L/min) were similar for STE (29.4), SF (27.6), and SG (28.9), and were not statistically significant (STE vs SF: P = 1.0, power = 5%; STE vs SG: P = .31, power = 16%; SF vs SG: P = .42, power = 14%). Both SF and SG had increased unilateral airflow volume (L/min) through the more obstructed nasal passage (median: STE 10.3, SF 12.2, SG 12.7), but these differences were not significant (STE vs SF: P = .19, power = 24%; STE vs SG P = .19, power = 30%). Furthermore, SF and SG had decreased unilateral nasal resistance (Pa s/mL) on the more obstructed side (median: STE 0.085, SF 0.072, SG 0.062) (STE vs SF: P = .13, power = 23%; STE vs SG P = .13, power = 24%). For all 3 models, heat flux distribution was greater in the anterior portion of the nasal passage than the posterior portions. Conclusions: Differences in nasal airflow and resistance after SF and SG were not statistically significant, but both procedures resulted in higher airflow rates and decreased nasal resistance through the more obstructed nasal passage.}

abstract = {Background Expert elicitation (EE) has been used across disciplines to estimate input parameters for computational modeling research when information is sparse or conflictual. Objectives We conducted a systematic review to compare EE methods used to generate model input parameters in health research. Data Sources PubMed and Web of Science. Study Eligibility Modeling studies that reported the use of EE as the source for model input probabilities were included if they were published in English before June 2021 and reported health outcomes. Data Abstraction and Synthesis Studies were classified as “formal” EE methods if they explicitly reported details of their elicitation process. Those that stated use of expert opinion but provided limited information were classified as “indeterminate” methods. In both groups, we abstracted citation details, study design, modeling methodology, a description of elicited parameters, and elicitation methods. Comparisons were made between elicitation methods. Study Appraisal Studies that conducted a formal EE were appraised on the reporting quality of the EE. Quality appraisal was not conducted for studies of indeterminate methods. Results The search identified 1520 articles, of which 152 were included. Of the included studies, 40 were classified as formal EE and 112 as indeterminate methods. Most studies were cost-effectiveness analyses (77.6%). Forty-seven indeterminate method studies provided no information on methods for generating estimates. Among formal EEs, the average reporting quality score was 9 out of 16. Limitations Elicitations on nonhealth topics and those reported in the gray literature were not included. Conclusions We found poor reporting of EE methods used in modeling studies, making it difficult to discern meaningful differences in approaches. Improved quality standards for EEs would improve the validity and replicability of computational models. Highlights We find extensive use of expert elicitation for the development of model input parameters, but most studies do not provide adequate details of their elicitation methods. Lack of reporting hinders greater discussion of the merits and challenges of using expert elicitation for model input parameter development. There is a need to establish expert elicitation best practices and reporting guidelines.}

abstract = {The prefix meta is popular in psychology as well as in other sciences oriented on the investigation of psychology. In the first case the usage is quite simple: every term is “the sum” of meta and usual psychological concept. In the second case, the situation is much more complicated. Sometimes, it is related to transition on a higher level of abstraction, from first-order to second-order investigations. Why is such a transition necessary and is it useful for scientific progress? The comparative analysis of the meta-approach to different sciences shows both specific peculiarities (reasons for application of the prefix, methods of manipulation and investigation, main objects of analysis, goals raised, and status of metaresearcher) and common features and regularities that may be discovered only in an interdisciplinary context. In this special section, we suggest a new way of application of meta-approach to psychology—in terms of metathinking. Our main idea is as follows: The wide circulation of meta-approach to psychology with necessity leads to serious changes in thinking of both researchers in the field of psychology and in sciences oriented on investigation of psychology.}

abstract = {A method for the solution of the three-dimensional structural dynamics equations with large strains using a finite volume technique is presented. The proposed solution procedure is second order accurate in space and employs a second-order accurate dual time-stepping scheme. The momentum conservation equations are written in terms of the Piola-Kirchhoff stresses. The stress tensor is related to the Lagrangian strain tensor through the St. Venant-Kirchhoff constitutive relationship. The structural solver presented is verified through two test cases. The first test case is a three-dimensional cantilever beam subject to a gravitational load that is verified using theory and two-dimensional simulations reported in literature. The second test case is a three-dimensional highly deformable cantilever plate subject to a gravitational load. The results of this case are verified through a comparison with the modal response calculated by commercially available software. The focus of the current effort is the development and verification of the structural dynamics portion of a future fully coupled monolithic fluid-thermal-structure interaction code package.}

abstract = {This study investigates pronoun interpretation by second language (L2) learners of English, focusing on whether first language (L1) transfer and/or processing difficulty affect L2 learners’ pronoun resolution. It is hypothesized that L2 learners’ non-target performance in L2-pronoun interpretation is attributable to two sources. The first is the computational complexity required for pronoun resolution, as argued in L1 acquisition by Grodzinsky and Reinhart and L2 acquisition by Slabakova et al. The second is how pronoun interpretation operates in L1. The hypothesis is tested by comparing Korean and Spanish L2-English learners’ interpretation of English pronouns using a Truth Value Judgment Task. Both groups had difficulty rejecting pronouns with local-referential antecedents when their proficiency levels were low. Additionally, Korean speakers showed more non-target responses than Spanish speakers due to their knowledge of pronoun interpretation in Korean. These results indicate that both L1 transfer and processing difficulty may be sources of L2 learners’ non-target pronoun interpretation, supporting the hypothesis of the study.}

abstract = {A curriculum enhancement project of embedding MATLAB and Simulink to a mechanical engineering (ME) vibrations and controls course is presented in this paper. MATLAB/Simulink is a popular software tool for vibration analysts and control designers, which is consistently regarded as one of the most in-demand technical skills that employers are looking for. In the past, the ME students at Mississippi State University (MSU) did not have the training opportunity to use MATLAB/Simulink for design and analysis of vibration and control systems. With the support of a teaching grants, the author created an experimental lab section to ask students to design and build vibration and control devices, and integrated these device into his vibrations and controls course. In this study, the author develops a computer lab section based on the implementation of MATLAB/Simulink, which complements with the experimental lab section to provide the students with a full lab experience. The experimental-computational lab allows the students to not only observe and characterize the dynamic response of vibration and control systems through experimental operations and measurements, but also validate experimental results and confirm experimental phenomena through computational analysis. As well as exploring dynamic behaviors of the systems in a variety of conditions through numerical simulations with different settings. An example of student project is presented to show an experimental-computational study conducted by a student team using MATLAB/Simulink software tool and self-developed data acquisition systems based on a base excitation model demonstrated in class. A questionnaire was conducted at the end of that class and results confirms that the implementation of MATLAB/Simulink into the course effectively develops the ME students’ programming skills and strengthens their capacity in modeling, simulating, and analyzing vibration, control, and other dynamic systems. The developed computational lab and the current experimental lab complementarily promote student understanding of principles and concepts conveyed in classroom lectures.}

abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is an indispensable simulation tool for predicting the emission of pollutants in the work environment. Welding is one of the most common industrial processes that might expose the operators and surrounding workers to certain hazardous gaseous metal fumes. In the present study, we used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology for simulating the emission of iron fumes from the shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) procedure. A galvanized steel chamber was fabricated to measure the pollutant concentration and identify the size of the fume created by the SMAW. Then, the emission of welding aerosol was simulated using a method of computational fluid-particle dynamics with the ANSYS 2020 R1 software. The highest amount of welding fumes concentration was related to iron fumes (i.e., 3045 μg/m3 with a diameter of 0.25 μm). The results of the current study indicated that the local exhaust and general ventilation system can prevent the spreading of welding fumes to the welder’s breathing zone and the surrounding environment. CFD was also found to be an efficient method for predicting the emission of the iron fumes created by SMAW as well as for selecting an appropriate ventilation system. However, further studies that take the modeling of welding-generated emission of additional metal particles and gases into account will need to be undertaken.}

abstract = {Digital trace data and computational methods are increasingly being used by researchers to study mental health phenomena (i.e. psychopathology and well-being) in social media. Computer-assisted mental health research is not simply a continuation of previous studies, but rather raises ethical, conceptual and methodological issues that are critical to behavioural science but have not yet been systematically explored. Based on a systematic review of n = 147 studies, we reveal a multidisciplinary field of research that has grown immensely since 2010, spanning the humanities, social sciences, and engineering. We find that a substantial majority of studies in our sample lack a standardized form of ethical consideration, focus on specific constructs and have a rather narrow focus on specific social media platforms. Based on our findings, we discuss how computational elements have influenced mental health research, highlight academic gaps and suggest promising directions for future studies.}

Three experiments are performed by means of computational fluid dynamics simulations, and the comparisons show good agreement between measured data and predicted results. The simulation results provide insight into the temperature and flow fields for the configuration at hand, revealing an entrainment effect. The influence of the water spray characteristics on the downward smoke displacement due to drag and cooling is explained. Furthermore, an extensive sensitivity study of the simulation results to input parameters and mesh size is performed. The inner spray angle (related to vertical water flux) and droplet size are shown to be key parameters when simulating downward smoke displacement caused by a spray.}

abstract = {Information and communications technology (ICT) is crucial in any contemporary society, especially if its online presence is to be widely significant, but, in a national context, it is important to investigate whether there is a compelling ICT ‘politic’ in the education sector in Turkey. This study specifically focuses on the ICT for Educational Development (ICT4ED) (Fatih) project, valued at US$8 billion, which is an embodiment of future educational reform in centralist Turkey. The study investigates the level of policy-making capacity within the scope of the Fatih project, which promises to fully integrate ICT into education in order to solve many educational issues, such as establishing entrepreneurialism in education, improving ICT sectors, exporting educational services to other nations for profit, and, ultimately, meeting the overarching purpose of Turkey becoming a competitive nation. The discourse of the government is to explore technological opportunities within education in order to create new ‘profitable’ avenues that conceive education as a ‘commodity’ and a ‘private good’, which is another feature of fragmented centralisation through public-private partnership(s) for both covert and overt privatisations. While the Fatih project defines the future as having new, ‘fully integrated ICT in education’, this study presents three main normative arguments — with regard to the project’s political execution, technical development and philosophical conception — to refute its objectives and highlight that it is destined to fail, and to suggest what urgent matters the ICT4ED politic should highlight in future education.}
