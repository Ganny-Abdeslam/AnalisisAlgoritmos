abstract = {Abstract Velocity measurements were made in the catalyst system of a firing engine using a one-component laser Doppler velocimetry system. The 1.4 l engine was operated at 2000 r/min and 88 per cent full-load condition. Velocity pulsations were observed in one of the runners supplying the catalyst and downstream of the catalyst. The velocity pulsations measured downstream of the catalyst enabled the mean velocity profile to be found. Observations were compared with simulations obtained from a coupling of the Star-CD computational fluid dynamics code, which modelled the catalyst as a three-dimensional component, with the Ricardo WAVE one-dimensional engine-cycle simulation code. The velocities in the runners were predicted to fluctuate between –65 m/s and 240 m/s. The observed velocity showed a similar pulse shape but a smaller magnitude of reversed flow. The velocities downstream of the catalyst were predicted to fluctuate between –5 and 22 m/s. The observed velocities showed smaller amplitude pulsations and significantly lower magnitudes of reversed flow, consistent with the input runner observations. The coupled simulation was shown to give good qualitative agreement with measurements, with quantitative predictions being most accurate near the catalyst centre but less accurate at locations closer to the outer wall.}

abstract = {A method and a computational tool oriented to assist the damage and safety evaluation of buildings after strong earthquakes is described in this article. The input of the model is the subjective and incomplete information on the building state, obtained by inspectors which are possibly not expert professionals of the field of building safety. The damage levels of the structural components are usually described by linguistic qualifications which can be adequately processed by computational intelligence techniques based on neuro-fuzzy systems what facilitate the complex and urgent tasks of engineering decision-making on the building occupancy after a seismic disaster. The hybrid neuro-fuzzy system used is based on a special three-layer feedforward artificial neural network and fuzzy rule bases and is an effective tool during the emergency response phase providing decisions about safety, habitability, and reparability of the buildings. Examples of application of the computer program are given for two different building classes.}

abstract = {The study presents unique teaching approach for generating a parametric modular facade fabrication for first-year students in visual design module using a computational visual coding method based on Truchet Tiles. The method followed four main phases: exploring tiling, testing connectivity, fabrication, and assembly. Shape grammar was considered during the design principles implementation to respond to climatic behavior. Space-filling shapes method known as the “Generalized Abeille Tiles” was followed to ensure tiling connectivity. The experimentation involves manual folding techniques without any software. A survey was conducted among first-year and fourth-year students post-introduction to computational software. The results showed a wide range of alternative geometries with different self-shading patterns generated. It highlighted that facade fabrication aided students in comprehending computational logic, easing the understanding of computational software complexity. This pilot study emphasizes the effectiveness of teaching computational concepts in early curricula.}

abstract = {Abstract The paper reviews experimental and computational research directed at improving the internal cooling of gas-turbine blades. While not the most glamorous area of gas-turbine aerothermodynamics, the improvements in overall thermal efficiency directly attributable to internal blade cooling arguably outstrip those achieved in any other area of jet-engine research. The cooling arrangements within a blade adopt three cooling strategies: impinging leading-edge jets, serpentine passages for the mid-blade section, and pin fins near the trailing edge. Progress in each of these areas is examined. Although, in the second of these areas, CFD studies have now become an essential weapon in the designer’s armoury, the other two still rely mostly on experimental research. Possible further developments are discussed.}

abstract = {This paper presents a nascent conceptual framework (The LISI4C framework) for designing a Library and Information Science (LIS) curriculum tailored to meet the demands of Industry 4.0 (4IR) in particularly South Africa, with global applicability. The framework is developed through an extensive literature review, drawing from a diverse range of sources. It integrates technical proficiencies, soft skills, adaptability, a global perspective, stakeholder collaboration, experiential learning, predictive skills, and a commitment to continuous curriculum updates to create a holistic educational model. The conceptual framework places technical skills at its core, and expertise in emerging technologies. Soft skills such as critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration, are integrated to foster a well-rounded skill set. A transdisciplinary approach encourages exploration beyond traditional LIS boundaries. The LISI4C framework also underscores the importance of sense-making, adaptability, and a global perspective in preparing graduates for the dynamic 4IR landscape. This paper contributes to the LIS education field by offering a forward-looking LISI4C framework that aligns LIS curriculum with the requirements of 4IR. The framework draws upon key elements, including technical proficiencies, soft skills, adaptability, a global perspective, stakeholder collaboration, experiential learning, predictive skills, and continuous curriculum updates, to create a holistic and forward-looking educational model.}

Classical Lie point symmetry analysis of this system resulted in admitted large Lie algebras for some special cases of the arbitrary constants and the source term. Symmetry reductions are performed and as such the system of partial differential equations is reduced to the system of ordinary differential equations. Some reduced ordinary differential equation could be solved exactly with restrictions on the parameters appearing in it. In addition, shooting quadrature is employed to numerically tackle the nonlinear model boundary value problem and pertinent results are presented graphically and discussed quantitatively.}

abstract = {We analyze and compare three different computational methods for a solar heating system with seasonal water tank heat storage (SHS-SWTHS). These methods are accurate numerical method, temperature stratification method, and uniform temperature method. The accurate numerical method can accurately predict the performance of the system, but it takes about 4 to 5 weeks, which is too long and hard for the performance analysis of this system. The temperature stratification method obtains relatively accurate computation results and takes a relatively short computation time, which is about 2 to 3 hours. Therefore, this method is most suitable for the performance analysis of this system. The deviation of the computational results of the uniform temperature method is great, and the time consumed is similar to that of the temperature stratification method. Therefore, this method is not recommended herein. Based on the above analyses, the temperature stratification method is applied to analyze the influence of the embedded depth of water tank, the thickness of thermal insulation material, and the collection area on the performance of this system. The results will provide a design basis for the related demonstration projects.}

abstract = {Is it possible to induce a mind-set that will affect relational thinking in a subsequent reasoning task involving unrelated materials? We investigated whether evaluating the validity of verbal analogies (Experiment 1a) or generating solutions for them (Experiment 1b) could induce a relational mind-set that would transfer to an unrelated picture-mapping task. The verbal analogies were based on either near or far semantic relations. We found that generating (but not evaluating) solutions for semantically distant analogies increased the proportion of relational mappings on the transfer task, even after we controlled for fluid intelligence and response time. Solving near analogies did not produce transfer. Generation of solutions to far analogies appears to provide a potent method for triggering a mind-set that can enhance relational thinking in a different task.}
