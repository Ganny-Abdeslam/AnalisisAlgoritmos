abstract = {This paper reports on comparing results on the fire environment predicted by using the technique of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) (or field modelling) on simulating an enclosure fire at the preflashover stage with those results reported experimentally in the literature. The theory behind this is to solve a system of partial differential equations describing conservation of mass, momentum and heat with the k-ε turbulence model. The computer pro gram PHOENICS is used as the simulation tool. By specifying the geometrical configurations of the enclosure and the location, size and thermal power of the fire source, it is possible to predict the fire-induced flow and temperature fields. The package can be executed in an IBM personal computer at or above 486 level. Experiments reported by Steckler et al. at the National Bureau of Stan dards, U.S.A. on a single fire chamber; Nakaya et al. at the Building Research Institute, Japan on a double room fire chamber; the corner fire plume by Tran and Janssens; the two-room fire experiment reported by Hagglund at the Na tional Defence Research Establishment (abbreviation: FOA), Sweden; and in the full-scale burning hall by Ingason and Olsson at the Swedish National Test ing and Research Institute (abbreviation: SP), Sweden are considered. Some of the results on the temperature and interface height of the smoke layer are com pared with the popular fire zone model CFAST.}

abstract = {In this paper a systematic introduction to computational neural network models is given in order to help spatial analysts learn about this exciting new field. The power of computational neural networks viz-à-viz conventional modelling is illustrated for an application field with noisy data of limited record length: spatial interaction modelling of telecommunication data in Austria. The computational appeal of neural networks for solving some fundamental spatial analysis problems is summarized and a definition of computational neural network models in mathematical terms is given. Three definitional components of a computational neural network—properties of the processing elements, network topology and learning—are discussed and a taxonomy of computational neural networks is presented, breaking neural networks down according to the topology and type of interconnections and the learning paradigm adopted. The attractiveness of computational neural network models compared with the conventional modelling approach of the gravity type for spatial interaction modelling is illustrated before some conclusions and an outlook are given.}

abstract = {This paper explores strategies for building toolchains to design, develop and fabricate architectural designs. It explains how complex curved structures can be constructed from flat standard panels. The hypothesis of this research is that by embedding ruled based procedures addressing generative, variational, iterative, and fabricational logics into early phases of design, both design techniques and digital fabrication methods can merge to solve a recurrent problem in contemporary architectural design, building double curved structures. Furthermore it achieves this using common fabrication methods and standard construction materials. It describes the processes of programming computational tools creating and developing designs to fabricate continuous complex curved structures. I describe this through a series of experiments, using parametric design environments and scripted functions, implementing certain techniques to fabricate these designs using rapid prototyping machines. Comparing different design and fabrication approaches I offer a discussion about universal application of programmed procedures into architectural design.}

abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess the use of a computational cognitive model for describing human performance with an adaptively automated system, with and without advance cueing of control mode transitions. A dual-task piloting simulation was developed to collect human performance data under auditory cueing or no cueing of automated or manual control. GOMSL models for simulating user behavior were constructed based on a theory of increased memory transactions at mode transitions. The models were applied to the same task simulation and scenarios performed by the humans. Comparison of results on human and model output demonstrated the model to be generally descriptive of performance; however, it was not accurate in predicting timing of memory use in preparing for manual control. Interestingly, the human data didn’t reveal differences between cued and no cue trials. A refined GOMSL model was developed by modifying assumptions on the timing and manner of memory use, and considering human parallel processing in dual-task performance. Results revealed the refined model to be more plausible for representing behavior. Computational cognitive modeling appears to be a viable approach to represent operator performance in adaptive systems.}

abstract = {Swets et al. (2008. Underspecification of syntactic ambiguities: Evidence from self-paced reading. Memory and Cognition, 36(1), 201–216) presented evidence that the so-called ambiguity advantage [Traxler et al. (1998). Adjunct attachment is not a form of lexical ambiguity resolution. Journal of Memory and Language, 39(4), 558–592], which has been explained in terms of the Unrestricted Race Model, can equally well be explained by assuming underspecification in ambiguous conditions driven by task-demands. Specifically, if comprehension questions require that ambiguities be resolved, the parser tends to make an attachment: when questions are about superficial aspects of the target sentence, readers tend to pursue an underspecification strategy. It is reasonable to assume that individual differences in strategy will play a significant role in the application of such strategies, so that studying average behaviour may not be informative. In order to study the predictions of the good-enough processing theory, we implemented two versions of underspecification: the partial specification model (PSM), which is an implementation of the Swets et al. proposal, and a more parsimonious version, the non-specification model (NSM). We evaluate the relative fit of these two kinds of underspecification to Swets et al.’s data; as a baseline, we also fitted three models that assume no underspecification. We find that a model without underspecification provides a somewhat better fit than both underspecification models, while the NSM model provides a better fit than the PSM. We interpret the results as lack of unambiguous evidence in favour of underspecification; however, given that there is considerable existing evidence for good-enough processing in the literature, it is reasonable to assume that some underspecification might occur. Under this assumption, the results can be interpreted as tentative evidence for NSM over PSM. More generally, our work provides a method for choosing between models of real-time processes in sentence comprehension that make qualitative predictions about the relationship between several dependent variables. We believe that sentence processing research will greatly benefit from a wider use of such methods.}

abstract = {The aims of this study are to clarify whether patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) have a decline in verbally or visually-based cognitive abilities and whether the possible decline is related to particular sleep depth changes. In addition, the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on the possible changes is investigated. Fifteen OSAS patients and 15 healthy controls joined two full-night polysomnographies, including a computational measure of deep sleep percentage (DS%) bilaterally from the frontal, central and occipital channels, and a neuropsychological assessment. After a 6-month CPAP the patients underwent one more full-night polysomnography with computational DS% analysis and a neuropsychological assessment. At the baseline, the OSAS patients had poorer performance in the Picture Completion, in the Digit Symbol and in copying the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (ROCFT) compared to the controls. The patients also showed reduced DS% in all 6 electrographic (EEG) channels compared to controls. The patients had an inter-hemispheric difference showing less deep sleep in the right hemisphere than in the left hemisphere both frontopolarly and centrally, while the controls showed this inter-hemispheric difference only frontopolarly. After CPAP the patients still had poorer performance in the Picture Completion and in the ROCFT. The patients continued to show reduced DS% in all 3 channels of the right hemisphere and occipitally in the left hemisphere, also the inter-hemispheric difference frontopolarly and centrally remained. OSAS patients have mild visually based cognitive dysfunction and reduced amount of deep sleep in the right hemisphere even after CPAP.}

abstract = {Computational simulations based on time-dependent Ginzburg—Landau equations are used to model martensitic phase transformations induced in pressure-shear plate impact experiments. Symmetric impact experiments on polycrystalline NiTi plates, and so-called “sandwich impact” experiments on thin polycrystalline NiTi foils sandwiched between two hard plates, are simulated by characterizing each grain as a three-dimensional finite element that can transform to twinned martensite involving twenty-four habit plane variants. The threshold stress at which the transformation occurs is obtained from the amplitude of the leading shear wave in the symmetric impact experiments. The kinetic coefficient in the Ginzburg—Landau equation is obtained by matching the risetime of the transverse particle velocity in the sandwich impact experiments. These simulations highlight the importance of including the effects of self-accommodation in which clusters of several habit plane variants nucleate and grow simultaneously to reduce the constraining effect of the surrounding material.}

abstract = {Film cooling effectiveness has been studied by using a computational approach based on solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. A wind tunnel test configuration is considered with a total of four cooling hole geometries as a cylindrical hole, a cylindrical hole with an upstream wedge (called ‘ramp’ thereafter), a shaped diffuser, and a double console slot. In all cases, the hole centreline has an inclination angle of 35° against the mainstream airflow and the blowing ratio is unity. Choosing the cylindrical model as a baseline, simulations have been carried out for grid convergence and turbulence model influence studies. Results are compared with available experimental data and other numerical predictions and good agreement has been achieved. Further computations continue with three remaining geometries, using the baseline flow conditions and configuration. Comparing to the results from the baseline model, it was found that the centreline adiabatic cooling effectiveness has shown incremental increases for the ‘ramp’ model, while results from the console slot model and the shape diffuser model have exhibited significant improvements by a factor of 1.5 and 2, respectively. The reason for such a step change in cooling effectiveness is mainly due to the weakening of the vortex structures in the vicinity of the hole exit, thus significantly reducing the entrainment of surrounding ‘hot’ fluids.}
