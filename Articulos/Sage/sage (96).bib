abstract = {This article presents a computational simulation framework developed to capture the ratcheting response of dented straight pipes. The results are compared against the results obtained from our previously conducted experiments. Ratcheting occurs when a structure is subjected to a primary axial load along with a secondary cyclic load, provided that the applied loads are sufficiently large in magnitude to cause the material to yield. The dented pipes investigated in this study were initially subjected to a monotonic axial compression load, which caused the initiation of small amplitude wrinkles, and were subsequently subjected to an axial cyclic loading regime. A nonlinear finite element analysis, using a combined hardening model, was adopted to model the response of the material during the entire loading regime. The parameters required by the material model were obtained from cyclic tests conducted on representative coupon specimens. The results of the numerical simulations were compared to experimentally obtained data. The results demonstrated that the ratcheting response of dented pipes could be numerically simulated with a reasonable accuracy. The results also revealed that the surface imperfections exerted a very pronounced effect on the ratcheting response of the dented pipes. The computational model was also used to investigate the influence of some key parameters, such as the initial strain level, stress amplitude, mean stress, loading regime, and material hardening properties, on the resulting ratcheting.}

abstract = {The independence axiom in axiomatic design (AD) states that the smaller functional dependency, the better system performance. This paper aims to develop an effective and widely applicable method for uncoupling design. First, the relationships, compatibilities, and possibility of integration between AD and systematic inventive thinking (SIT) are analysed. According to the analysis, a new uncoupling method based on SIT is proposed. Next, the detailed uncoupling steps of this method are explained and a strategy to upgrade an old system or develop new systems based on an existing one is proposed in terms of this uncoupling method. Then, an example of solving vibration and noise problem of flushing facility is used to illuminate this method. Finally, a discussion of the proposed uncoupling method and the possible extension of this method with theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ) are presented. This proposed uncoupling method is different from the conventional approaches, which avoids measuring functional dependency, harmonizing parameters, or searching substitutable technological ideas.}

abstract = {This study explores discourse features on Facebook pages of news organizations during the 2020 U.S. primary debates using a state-of-the-art machine-learning model. Informing the scholarly debate about the implications of strategic game reporting in online spaces, we find that it is not necessarily linked to uncivil discourse, yet it might deter from relevant conversations. Second, addressing fears about the undesired outcomes of uncivil talk, our data suggest that incivility can coexist with rational discourse in user comments, although this relationship is not pervasive. Implications of these results are discussed in the context of the role of hybrid media for political engagement during electoral campaigns.}

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the theoretical foundation and implementation of two alternative instructional courses that aimed to support the development of elementary school students’ early algebraic thinking. Both courses approached three basic algebra content strands: generalized arithmetic, functional thinking and modelling languages. The courses differed according to the characteristics of the tasks that were used. The first course involved ‘pure mathematical guided investigations’ emphasizing scaffolding steps in pure mathematics contexts. The second course focused on ‘applied open explorations’ underlining more open questions in applied everyday contexts. The courses were compared in respect to students’ learning outcomes. The findings, yielded from the analysis of pre-test and post-test data, indicated that the second course had better learning outcomes compared to the first.}

abstract = {Abstract Underbonnet simulations are proving to be crucially important within a vehicle development programme, reducing test work and time-to-market. While computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of steady forced flows have been demonstrated to be reliable, studies of transient convective flows in engine compartments are not yet carried out owing to high computing demands and lack of validated work. The present work assesses the practical feasibility of applying the CFD tool at the initial stage of a vehicle development programme for investigating the thermally driven flow in an engine bay under thermal soak. A computation procedure that enables pseudo time-marching CFD simulations to be performed with significantly reduced central processing unit (CPU) time usage is proposed. The methodology was initially tested on simple geometries and then implemented for investigating a simplified half-scale underbonnet compartment. The numerical results are compared with experimental data taken with thermocouples and with particle image velocimetry (PIV). The novel computation methodology is successful in efficiently providing detailed and time-accurate time-dependent thermal and flow predictions. Its application will extend the use of the CFD tool for transient investigations, enabling improvements to the component packaging of engine bays and the refinement of thermal management strategies with reduced need for in-territory testing.}

abstract = {We present a novel computational approach to optimizing the morphological design of robots. Our framework takes as input a parameterized robot design as well as a motion plan consisting of trajectories for end-effectors and, optionally, for its body. The algorithm optimizes the design parameters including link lengths and actuator placements whereas concurrently adjusting motion parameters such as joint trajectories, actuator inputs, and contact forces. Our key insight is that the complex relationship between design and motion parameters can be established via sensitivity analysis if the robot’s movements are modeled as spatiotemporal solutions to an optimal control problem. This relationship between form and function allows us to automatically optimize the robot design based on specifications expressed as a function of actuator forces or trajectories. We evaluate our model by computationally optimizing four simulated robots that employ linear actuators, four-bar linkages, or rotary servos. We further validate our framework by optimizing the design of two small quadruped robots and testing their performances using hardware implementations.}

abstract = {Various investigations on open rotor (OR) hovering in-ground effect (IGE) are carried out, but few papers report shrouded rotor (SR) hovering IGE. This paper compares aerodynamic performance and flowfield characteristics of OR and SR hovering IGE by both experimental measurements and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations. Experimental results reveal that in IGE flight, the aerodynamic performance of SR is more sensitive than that of OR. And at constant power, SR offers more thrust than OR at the same ground distance. Ground has a great influence on thrust for OR below 2.2 rotor radius distance, while for SR it shows obvious effect below 1.5 rotor radius distance. It is also shown that normalized aerodynamic coefficients of OR and SR are independent on rotor speed. In addition, for OR the rotor thrust coefficient changes nearly linearly with the logarithmic distance from ground, while for SR it changes nonlinearly. Flowfield analysis by CFD shows that shroud changes the tip flow features and expands the slipstream area of SR. When ground distance gets small, back pressure below the rotor-disk plane increases, which is more obvious for SR than OR. Furthermore, shroud thrust of SR decreases because of tip leakage flow and flow separation.}

abstract = {We present a computational model of learned avoidance behavior in a one-way avoidance experiment. Our model employs the reinforcement learning paradigm and a temporal-difference algorithm to implement both classically conditioned and instrumentally conditioned components. The role of the classically conditioned component is to develop an expectation of future benefit that is a function of the learning system’s state and action. Competition among the instrumentally conditioned components determines the overt behavior generated by the learning system. Our model displays, in simulation, the reduced latency of the avoidance behavior during learning with continuing trials and the resistance to extinction of the avoidance response. These results are consistent with experimentally observed animal behavior. Our model extends the traditional two-process learning mechanism of Mowrer by explicitly defining the mechanisms of proprioceptive feedback, an internal clock, and generalization over the action space.}

abstract = {A new frequency-domain implementation of a synthetic aperture focusing technique is presented in the paper. The concept is based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and sonar that is a developed version of the convolution model in the frequency domain. Compared with conventional line-by-line imaging, synthetic aperture imaging has a better resolution and contrast at the cost of more computational load. To overcome this problem, point-by-point reconstruction methods have been replaced by block-processing algorithms in radar and sonar; however, these techniques are relatively unknown in medical imaging. In this paper, we extended one of these methods called wavenumber to medical ultrasound imaging using a simple model of synthetic aperture focus. The model, derived here for monostatic mode, can be generalized to multistatic as well. The method consists of 4 steps: a 2D fast Fourier transform of the data, frequency shift of the data to baseband, interpolation to convert polar coordinates to rectangular ones, and returning the data to the spatial-domain using a 2D inverse Fourier transform. We have also used chirp pulse excitation followed by matched filtering and spotlighting algorithm to compensate the effect of differences in parameters between radar and medical imaging. Computational complexities of the two methods, wavenumber and delay-and-sum (DAS), have been calculated. Field II simulated point data have been used to evaluate the results in terms of resolution and contrast. Evaluations with simulated data show that for typical phantoms, reconstruction by the wavenumber algorithm is almost 20 times faster than classical DAS while retaining the resolution.}
