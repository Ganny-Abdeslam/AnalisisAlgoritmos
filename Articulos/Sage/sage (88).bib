abstract = {As the media industry moves to a post-industrial model, there is a need for journalists—current and future—to have a deeper understanding of the ways that technology impacts their work and how best to produce journalism for mobile and networked devices. This article examines a teaching initiative designed to introduce journalism students to elements of social and mobile technology theory and design practice. Using feedback gained from peers, students, and industry professionals, the initiative was deemed successful; however, we outline several recommendations for improvement.}

abstract = {Abstract This article addresses two modelling aspects of wind turbine aerofoil aerodyna-mics based on the solution of the Reynolds-averaged Navier—Stokes (RANS) equations. One of these is the effect of an a priori method for structured grid adaptation aimed at improving the wake resolution. The presented results emphasize that the proposed adaptation strategy greatly improves the wake resolution in the far field, whereas the wake is completely diffused by the non-adapted grid with the same number and spacing patterns of grid nodes. The proposed adaptation approach can be easily included in the structured generation process of both commercial and in-house-structured mesh generators. The other numerical aspect examined herein is the impact of particular choices for turbulence modelling on the predicted solution. This includes the comparative analysis of numerical solutions obtained by using different turbulence models, and also aims at quantifying the solution inaccuracy arising from not modelling the laminar-to-turbulent transition. It is found that the drag forces obtained by considering the flow as transitional or fully turbulent may differ by 50 per cent. All these issues are investigated using a special-purpose hyperbolic grid generator and two multi block structured finite volume RANS codes. The numerical experiments consider the flow field past a wind turbine aerofoil for which an exhaustive campaign of steady and unsteady experimental measurements was conducted. The predictive capabilities of the CFD solvers are validated by comparing experimental data and numerical predictions for selected flow regimes. The incompressible analysis and design code XFOIL is also used to support the findings of the comparative analysis of numerical RANS-based results and experimental data.}

abstract = {Locomotive sanders are used to optimize the traction between the train wheels and the railhead by spraying sand into the interface. It has been previously shown that a large fraction of sand sprayed by the sanders does not make it through the wheel–rail nip, leading to sand wastage and thereby increasing the cost and refilling effort. In this study, pneumatic conveying of sand through the wheel–rail nip is numerically modeled through coupled computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method simulations. The gas phase, discrete phase, and coupled two-phase flows are separately validated against the literature, and the parameters affecting the deposition of sand into the nip are analyzed to determine their impact on sander efficiency. The aerodynamics associated with the particle-laden jet play a critical role in optimizing the amount of sand going through the wheel–rail interface, with the particle velocities being directly correlated with the sander efficiency. Particle–geometry interactions (e.g. particle bouncing) are found to have a negligible effect on the deposition. In the absence of crosswinds, it is recommended to employ particles with a smaller Stokes number to enhance the sander efficiency. A larger airflow rate through the nozzle is also recommended. Crosswinds strongly and adversely affect sander efficiency. The effects of crosswinds can be mitigated by reducing the nip–nozzle distance and using coarser particles.}

abstract = {Carbon nanotube polymer composites exhibit piezoresistivity that can be utilized for flexible strain sensors. Piezoresistive modeling is critical for improving sensor performance, but remains a challenging subject due to the complex CNT network microstructure and the various effects occurring at both the micro and nano scales. Tunneling conduction between CNTs is the primary mechanism underlying piezoresistivity in carbon nanotube polymer composites. Existing models have employed a myriad of assumptions on the CNT network kinematics and the tunneling conduction behavior, but their physical basis and effects have not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, a detailed evaluation on these modeling assumptions is presented with the goal of establishing an approach without ad hoc assumptions and improved predictive accuracy. A computational model that is capable of tracking the history of tunneling separation of each CNT junction is first constructed. The effects of CNT extensibility, tunneling cross-section, conduction channels are studied via statistical analysis of the tunneling conduction and comparison of computed piezoresistive response. It is found that CNT inextensibility leads to higher predicted piezoresistivity, the tunneling cross-section area in the Simmons approximation is a highly influential parameter, and the Landauer formula provides a more physically based approach that accounts for CNT properties.}

abstract = {The authors argue that journalism’s uncertain identity in academia has made it vulnerable to unreflective instrumentalism in the digital era. They show how instrumentalism intertwined with the digital sublime constitutes a rhetorically resonate rationale for closing a journalism school. Evidence comes from documents and testimony associated with discontinuance of the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Colorado. Vulnerability of the school became apparent in its own Advisory Board recommending closure. The authors warn against stakeholders in journalism education internalizing the fear and opportunism implicit in a discourse of the digital sublime, a discourse ultimately in service to discontinuance.}

abstract = {Purpose A-v anastomosis entails dramatic changes in hemodynamic conditions, which may lead to major alterations to the vessels involved; primarily dilatations and devastating stenoses. Wall shear stress is thought to play a key role in the remodeling of the vessels exposed to abnormal levels and oscillating wall shear stress. In this study we sought to develop a framework suitable for thorough in vivo analyses of wall shear stress and vessel morphology of a-v fistulas in patients. Methods Using ultrasound and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) transverse image stacks from six patient a-v fistulas were obtained. From the image stacks three-dimensional geometries of the patient fistulas were created using dedicated segmentation software. Geometries of three a-v fistulas were imported into Finite Element software in order to perform fluid flow simulations of blood flows and frictional forces on the vessel walls in the a-v fistulas. Boundary conditions for the simulations were obtained using both a MRI Phase Contrast and an Ultrasound Doppler technique. Results The segmentation of the six fistulas of very different age and morphology (two end-to-side and four side-to-side) showed the ability of the approach to create geometries of various fistula morphologies. Simulations of the three fistulas showed an instant picture of the present status of the exposure to different levels of wall shear stress and the morphological status in the vessel remodeling process. Conclusion The study demonstrated the capability of the CFD framework to analyze patient a-v fistulas on a regular basis using both MRI and ultrasound-based approaches.}

abstract = {To follow a goal-directed behavior, an autonomous agent must be able to acquire knowledge about the causality between its motor actions and corresponding sensory feedback. Since the complexity of such sensorimotor relationships directly influences required cognitive resources, this work proposes that it is of importance to keep the agent’s sensorimotor relationships simple. This implies that the agent should be designed in a way such that sensory consequences can be described and predicted in a simplified manner. Living organisms implement this paradigm by adapting sensory and motor systems specifically to their behavior and environment. As a result, they are able to predict sensorimotor consequences with a strongly limited amount of (expensive) nervous tissue. In this context, the present work proposes that advantageous artificial sensory and motor layouts can be evolved by rewarding the ability to predict self-induced stimuli through simple sensorimotor relationships. Experiments consider a simulated agent recording realistic visual stimuli from natural images. The obtained results demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to (i) synthesize visual sensorimotor structures adapted to an agent’s environment and behavior, and (ii) serve as a computational model for testing hypotheses regarding the development of biological visual sensorimotor systems.}
