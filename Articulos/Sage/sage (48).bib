abstract = {This article discusses work on implementing emotional and cultural models into synthetic graphical characters. An architecture, FAtiMA, implemented first in the antibullying application FearNot! and then extended as FAtiMA-PSI in the cultural-sensitivity application ORIENT, is discussed. We discuss the modelling relationships between culture, social interaction, and cognitive appraisal. Integrating a lower level homeostatically based model is also considered as a means of handling some of the limitations of a purely symbolic approach. Evaluation to date is summarised and future directions discussed.}

abstract = {The simulation of cardiac electrophysiology is a mature field in computational physiology. Recent advances in medical imaging, high-performance computing and numerical methods mean that computational models of electrical propagation in human heart tissue are ripe for use in patient-specific simulation for diagnosis, for prognosis and for selection of treatment methods. However, in order to move in this direction, it is necessary to make efficient use of modern petascale computing resources. This paper focuses on an existing open source simulation framework (Chaste) and documents work done to improve the parallel scaling on a small range of electrophysiology benchmark problems. These benchmarks involve the numerical solution of the monodomain or bidomain equations via the finite-element method. At the beginning of this study the electrophysiology libraries within Chaste were already enabled to run in parallel and were able to solve for electrical propagation using the monodomain or bidomain equations, but parallel efficiency dropped rapidly when run on more than about 64 processors. Throughout the course of the study, improvements were made to problem definition input; geometric mesh partitioning; finite-element assembly of large, sparse linear systems; problem-specific matrix preconditioning; numerical solution of the linear system; and output of the approximate solution. The consequence of these improvements is that, at the end of the study, Chaste is able to solve a monodomain benchmark problem in close to real time. While some of the improvements made to the parallel Chaste code are specific to cardiac electrophysiology, many of the techniques documented in this paper are generic to the parallel finite-element method in other scientific application areas.}

The scope of the work is to describe the flow by means of computational fluid dynamics past the leading two cars of the train for yaw angles in the range 12.2–40.0°. Three track formations are utilized. The basic results are the set of independent aerodynamic coefficients for the lead and subsequent cars. The results are to some extent compared with experimental data for ICE 2 and also with data obtained for the Swedish high-speed train X2000. A numerical sensitivity study is undertaken to quantify differences in the above results dependent on the grid density and quality, turbulence model, numerical scheme, location of inlet and outlet boundaries, turbulence intensity and flow simulation software.}

abstract = {Objective Healthcare systems require transformation to meet societal challenges and projected health demands. Digital and computational tools and approaches are fundamental to this transformation, and hospitals have a key role to play in their development and implementation. This paper reports on a study with the objective of exploring the challenges encountered by hospital leaders and innovators as they implement a strategy to become a data-driven hospital organisation. In doing so, this paper provides guidance to future leaders and innovators seeking to build computational and digital capabilities in complex clinical settings. Methods Interviews were undertaken with 42 participants associated with a large public hospital organisation within England’s National Health Service. Using the concept of institutional readiness as an analytical framework, the paper explores participants’ perspectives on the organisation’s capacity to support the development of, and benefit from, digital and computational approaches. Results Participants’ accounts reveal a range of specific institutional readiness criteria relating to organisational vision, technical capability, organisational agility, and talent and skills that, when met, enhance the organisations’ capacity to support the development and implementation of digital and computational tools. Participant accounts also reveal challenges relating to these criteria, such as unrealistic expectations and the necessary prioritisation of clinical work in resource-constrained settings. Conclusions The paper identifies a general set of institutional readiness criteria that can guide future hospital leaders and innovators aiming to improve their organisation’s digital and computational capability. The paper also illustrates the challenges of pursuing digital and computational innovation in resource-constrained hospital environments.}

abstract = {Objectives: Competent velopharyngeal (VP) function is the basis for normal speech. Understanding how VP structure influences the airflow during speech details is essential to the surgical improvement of pharyngoplasty. In this study, we aimed to illuminate the airflow features corresponding to various VP closure states using computed dynamic simulations. Methods: Three-dimensional models of the upper airways were established based on computed tomography of 8 volunteers. The velopharyngeal port was simulated by a cylinder. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were applied to illustrate the correlation between the VP port size and the airflow parameters, including the flow velocity, pressure in the velopharyngeal port, as well as the pressure in oral and nasal cavity. Results: The airflow dynamics at the velopharynx were maintained in the same velopharyngeal pattern as the area of the velopharyngeal port increased from 0 to 25 mm2. A total of 5 airflow patterns with distinct features were captured, corresponding to adequate closure, adequate/borderline closure (Class I and II), borderline/inadequate closure, and inadequate closure. The maximal orifice area that could be tolerated for adequate VP closure was determined to be 2.01 mm2. Conclusion: Different VP functions are of characteristic airflow dynamic features. Computational fluid dynamic simulation is of application potential in individualized VP surgery planning.}

abstract = {Past research has shown that multidimensional computational fluid dynamics modeling in combination with a genetic algorithm method is an effective approach for optimizing internal combustion engine design. However, optimization studies performed with a detailed computational fluid dynamics model are time intensive, which limits the practical application of this approach. This study addresses this issue by using a machine learning approach called Gaussian process regression in combination with computational fluid dynamics modeling to reduce the computational optimization time. An approach was proposed where the Gaussian process regression model could be used instead of the computational fluid dynamics model to predict the outputs of the genetic algorithm optimization. In this approach, for every nth generation of the genetic algorithm, the data from the previous n − 1 generations was used to train the Gaussian process regression model. The approach was tested on an engine optimization study with five input parameters. When the genetic algorithm was run solely with computational fluid dynamics, the optimization took 50 days to complete. In comparison with the computational fluid dynamics and Gaussian process regression approach, the computational time was reduced by 62%, and the optimization was completed in 19 days using the same amount of computational resources. Additional parametric studies were performed to investigate the impact of genetic algorithm + Gaussian process regression parameters. Results showed that either reducing the initial dataset size or relaxing the error criterion resulted in increased Gaussian process regression evaluations within the genetic algorithm. However, relaxing the error criterion was found to impact the model predictions negatively. The initial dataset size was found to have a negligible impact on the final optimum design. Finally, the potential of machine learning in further improving the optimization process was explored by using the Gaussian process regression model to check for the robustness of the designs to operating parameter variations during the optimization. The genetic algorithm was repeated with the modified procedure and it was shown that adding the stability check resulted in a different, more reliable and stable optimum solution.}

abstract = {Introduction: The volume of blood flowing through the vascular access is an important parameter necessary to provide adequate dialysis for a functional arteriovenous fistula. Higher blood flows are seen in arteriovenous access that receive inflow from larger arteries such as brachial or axillary compared to those based on medium-caliber radial or ulnar arteries. We hypothesized that an anatomic difference in the length and the diameter of the artery is an important determinant of the flow volume in arteriovenous fistula created at different anatomic locations. Methods: Using computational fluid dynamics, we evaluated the contribution of the length and diameter of inflow artery on simulations performed with geometric models constructed to represent arteriovenous fistula circuits. Lengths and diameters of the inflow artery were altered to mimic arteriovenous fistula created at various locations of the upper extremity with standard and variant anatomy. Results: Models of arteriovenous fistula created with variable lengths and diameters of the inflow artery suggest that the length of the vessel has an inverse linear relationship and the diameter has a direct linear relationship to flow volume. Conclusion: Computational fluid dynamic modeling of arteriovenous fistula can be used to understand the physiologic basis of clinical observations of function. Evaluation of the effect of inflow artery length and diameter helps explain the higher flows seen in arteriovenous fistula created using large caliber arteries for inflow. Computational fluid dynamic modeling helps operators understand the contributions of inflow artery in access function and can guide anastomotic site selection.}

abstract = {There is considerable controversy surrounding the study of presidential debates, particularly efforts to connect their content and impact. Research has long debated whether the citizenry reacts to what candidates say, how they say it, or simply how they appear. This study uses detailed coding of the first 2012 debate between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney to test the relative influence of the candidates’ verbal persuasiveness and nonverbal features on viewers’ “second screen” behavior—their use of computers, tablets, and mobile phones to enhance or extend the televised viewing experience. To examine these relationships, we merged two datasets: (1) a shot-by-shot content analysis coded for functional, tonal, and visual elements of both candidates’ communication behavior during the debate; and (2) corresponding real-time measures, synched and lagged, of the volume and sentiment of Twitter expression about Obama and Romney. We find the candidates’ facial expressions and physical gestures to be more consistent and robust predictors of the volume and valence of Twitter expression than candidates’ persuasive strategies, verbal utterances, and voice tone during the debate.}

abstract = {We present results obtained with new instrumental methods for the acoustic analysis of prosody to evaluate prosody production by children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Typical Development (TD). Two tasks elicit focal stress — one in a vocal imitation paradigm, the other in a picture-description paradigm; a third task also uses a vocal imitation paradigm, and requires repeating stress patterns of two-syllable nonsense words. The instrumental methods differentiated significantly between the ASD and TD groups in all but the focal stress imitation task. The methods also showed smaller differences in the two vocal imitation tasks than in the picture-description task, as was predicted. In fact, in the nonsense word stress repetition task, the instrumental methods showed better performance for the ASD group. The methods also revealed that the acoustic features that predict auditory-perceptual judgment are not the same as those that differentiate between groups. Specifically, a key difference between the groups appears to be a difference in the balance between the various prosodic cues, such as pitch, amplitude, and duration, and not necessarily a difference in the strength or clarity with which prosodic contrasts are expressed.}
