abstract = {Accumulating evidence from cognitive neuroscience indicates that the right inferior parietal cortex, at the junction with the posterior temporal cortex, plays a critical role in various aspects of social cognition such as theory of mind and empathy. With a quantitative meta-analysis of 70 functional neuroimaging studies, the authors demonstrate that this area is also engaged in lower-level (bottom-up) computational processes associated with the sense of agency and reorienting attention to salient stimuli. It is argued that this domain-general computational mechanism is crucial for higher level social cognitive processing. NEUROSCIENTIST 13(6): 580—593, 2007. DOI: 10.1177/1073858407304654}

abstract = {Innovative information technology is developing rapidly and is penetrating many areas of life, including education. The paper measures the impact of innovative information technology, using augmented reality (AR) as an example, on the development of creativity and critical thinking among students. The study was conducted among 180 students from Tonghua Normal University in China. The research design: a pre-test and post-test experiment with a control group. The following research findings were obtained: academic knowledge of the experimental group was higher (15.73) than that of the control group (12.13). ARLE model improved critical thinking (8.77 in AR group, 7.60 in the traditional group) and creativity (593 in AR group, 570 in the traditional group). The resulting data demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model of learning with the augmented reality technology. The research findings have practical implications. For example, they may be used to create new augmented reality apps for other disciplines and majors. The study presents recommendations on the development of creative and critical thinking, which teachers of various disciplines can apply in practice. The impact of other digital tools in education needs to be carefully studied to determine their effectiveness.}

abstract = {Abstract Hemming is a three-step sheet-folding process utilized in the production of automotive closures. It has a critical imact on the performance and perceived quality of assembled vehicles. Using a two-dimensional finite element model, this paper presents a design-of-experiments (DOE) study of the relationships between important hemming process parameters and hem quality for aluminium alloy AA 6111-T4PD flat surface-straight edge hemming. The quality measures include roll-in/roll-out of the hem edge as well as the maximum true strain on the exposed bent surface. The finite element (FE) model combines explicit and implicit procedures in simulating the three forming subprocesses (flanging, pre-hemming, and final hemming) along with the corresponding springback (unloading). The results show that the pre-hemming die angle and the flanging die radius have the greatest influence on hem edge roll-in/roll-out, while pre-strain and the flanging die radius impact the maximum surface strain significantly. The computational DOE results also provide the basis for process parameter selection to avoid hem surface cracking and particular insights for achieving acceptable formability.}

abstract = {Recently there has been an increase in the number of researchers who use rational choice models to explain single cases and rare events. Because of the small number of cases under study, these researchers must rely either explicitly or implicitly on counterfactual reasoning. This paper argues that computational methods provide a profitable means of carrying out rigorous counterfactual analysis. The authors advocate robustness analysis as one important part of the counterfactual analysis of formal theories. Specifically, they evaluate the robustness of the behavioral assumptions of two formal models using various heuristic search algorithms and Markov chains. They find that Kuran’s (1989) threshold model of mass protest and Ingberman’s (1985) model of direct-democracy referenda are robust to perturbations in their behavioral assumptions. These findings increase the plausibility of causal claims made by scholars who use these models to explain specific events.}

In a new synthesis that permits straightforward generalization of previously published results, spatial and temporal windowing functions are employed to provide equivalent-source expressions to account for both initial and boundary conditions. Detailed results describe the transformation of both source terms and Green’s functions to take account of uniform subsonic mean flow, and expressions are given for free-field Green’s functions, both with and without flow, in time, frequency and wavenumber domains. A worked example illustrates the non-uniqueness of the Green’s function for a simple one-dimensional bounded problem.}

abstract = {We perform a socio-computational interrogation of the google search by image algorithm, a main component of the google search engine. We audit the algorithm by presenting it with more than 40 thousands faces of all ages and more than four races and collecting and analyzing the assigned labels with the appropriate statistical tools. We find that the algorithm reproduces white male patriarchal structures, often simplifying, stereotyping and discriminating females and non-white individuals, while providing more positive descriptions of white men. By drawing from Bourdieu’s theory of cultural reproduction, we link these results to the attitudes of the algorithm’s designers, owners, and the dataset the algorithm was trained on. We further underpin the problematic nature of the algorithm by using the ethnographic practice of studying-up: We show how the algorithm places individuals at the top of the tech industry within the socio-cultural reality that they shaped, many times creating biased representations of them. We claim that the use of social-theoretic frameworks such as the above are able to contribute to improved algorithmic accountability, algorithmic impact assessment and provide additional and more critical depth in algorithmic bias and auditing studies. Based on the analysis, we discuss the scientific and design implications and provide suggestions for alternative ways to design just socio-algorithmic systems.}

abstract = {This research article aims to describe how the confluence of financial economics, mathematics and computational technologies can prove to be so effective in the practice of financial engineering. As per modern demands, financial derivatives constitute a vast and rapidly growing portion of the global financial markets. The tool is being used exponentially in portfolio management and for hedging purposes and thus, strong efforts have been projected on modelling of derivative products. In addition, this research article also addresses one of the major problems of pricing European plain vanilla options namely the constant volatility assumption of the Black-Scholes model concentrating the volatility of the underlying assets. Since pricing bias emerges as the most dominant feature of Black-Scholes whenever applied with options and this is the main cause why Black-Scholes model is not widely operated upon in pricing of complex non-vanilla options. However, despite the pricing bias problem, amid its simplicity the Black-Scholes framework dominates the pricing of European style options traded on exchanges, since its inception. The issue of eliminating the price bias has already occupied a huge space in previous published literature of this stream, thus instead of focusing on the price bias of Black-Scholes this work is an attempt to resolve and suggest some of the finest solutions of the financial mathematics to overcome this complex problem of option pricing.}

abstract = {To evaluate thermal protective performance of fire proof garment under flash fire exposures, it is important to discuss garment heat transfer characteristics eliminating the effect of air gaps between garment and body. In this study, a test of flame manikin clothed with close-fitting garment was designed. And a three-dimensional transient heat transfer computational fluid dynamics simulation of the test was achieved to gain the garment surface temperature. By means of three-dimensional body scanner, Geomagic and Gambit software, we developed a method of three-dimensional geometrical modeling of the full-scale close-fitting clothed manikin. The accuracy of the computational fluid dynamics simulation was validated by actual experiments. It was found that the average incident heat flux to the exterior of the Nomex® IIIA garment is not 84 kW/m2, the value measured in nude manikin tests, but the value is 11% lower than it. This will help to set more accurate boundary conditions on garment surface in further simulations.}

abstract = {Fluid flow in the intertrabecular spaces of vertebral bone has been implicated in a number of physiological phenomena. Despite the potential clinical significance of the flow of various fluids through the intertrabecular cavities, the intrinsic permeability of trabecular bone is not fully characterized or understood. Furthermore, very little is known about the interdependence of permeability and morphological parameters. The main purpose of this study is to characterize computational methods to determine intrinsic bone permeability from three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) image stacks that were, depending on the underlying algorithm of each model, acquired at a spatial resolution ranging from the order of 500 μm (macroscale) up to 10 μm (microscale). A Finite Element formulation of the steady-state Stokes flow and an in house developed pore network modeling approach compute permeability on the microscopic length scale. To approximate the geometry of the trabecular bone network, a cellular model is used to map morphological information into intrinsic permeability by means of a log-linear regression equation. If the image resolution is too low for the quantification of the trabecular bone architecture, permeability is directly derived by fitting a simplified version of the log-linear regression equation to the CT Hounsfield values. Depending on the resolution of the raw image data and the chosen model, permeability value correlations are 0.31 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.90 compared to the Finite Element method, that is referred to as the baseline for any comparisons in this study. Furthermore, we found no significant dependence of the intrinsic permeability on the trabecular thickness parameter.}
