abstract = {A call has been made over the last decade for the expansion of epidemiology coursework into high schools in the United States. Epidemiology instruction has been shown to increase student scientific and health literacy, promote critical thinking skills, enhance students’ perception of public health as both practical and relevant, and empower students as independent, lifelong learners. Epidemiology is also a flexible science with relevance to students from diverse backgrounds, skill levels, and interests. While there has been tremendous growth in undergraduate public health education, we have yet to witness the mainstream adoption of epidemiology into high school coursework. In this article, I propose the formal integration of epidemiology into high school curricula to help students practice science as it relates to public health. I posit that epidemiology is a flexible science discipline with real-world significance to students from diverse backgrounds, skill levels, and interests. Also, teaching epidemiology through guided inquiry and authentic learning strategies can intrinsically motivate and empower students to address health-related problems in their local communities. Moreover, epidemiology instruction at the high school level can meet student learning needs, teacher instructional objectives, administrative mandates, and community interests. In essence, epidemiology instruction at the high school level can hone fundamental skills in preparation for health and science careers and promote important public health awareness and interest among adolescents.}

abstract = {With the release of the Next Generation Science Standards and the adoption of the standards by many states, teachers are encouraged to use the engineering design process (EDP) as an instructional approach to teaching science. However, teachers have limited time to teach science and will often neglect science in favor of mathematics and literacy instruction. To make this feasible for elementary classrooms, teachers should be encouraged to implement integrated units of study utilizing EDP to cohesively bind content areas and to increase active learning, critical thinking, and problem solving among all learners. An additional benefit of using EDP as an instructional strategy is the focus on problem solving and the avoidance of one size fits all learning. Students actively engage in learning content (science, mathematics, literacy, social studies) as they collaboratively work together to solve societal and environmental problems. Knowledge is built as students progress through the challenges and content is provided on a need to know basis, thereby differentiating instruction based on learner needs and challenging gifted learners. In this article, the author provides four sample engineering challenges that can be used to create an integrated unit of study using the EDP as an instructional strategy.}

abstract = {Is the relationship between criminal thinking and recidivism the same for criminal justice–involved individuals from varying demographic backgrounds? Relying on two independent samples of offenders and two measures of criminal thinking, the current studies examined whether four demographic factors—gender, race, age, and education—moderated the relationship between criminal thinking and recidivism. Study 1 consisted of 226 drug-involved probationers enrolled in a randomized clinical trial. Study 2 consisted of 346 jail inmates from a longitudinal study. Logistic regression models suggested that the strength of the relationship between criminal thinking and subsequent recidivism did not vary based on participant demographics, regardless of justice system setting or measure of criminal thinking. Criminal thinking predicts recidivism similarly for people who are male, female, Black, White, older, younger, and more or less educated.}

abstract = {Discussions about the replicability of psychological studies have primarily focused on improving research methods and practices, with less attention paid to the role of well-specified theories in facilitating the production of reliable empirical results. The field is currently in need of clearly articulated steps to theory specification and development, particularly regarding frameworks that may generalize across different fields of psychology. Here we focus on two approaches to theory specification and development that are typically associated with distinct research traditions: computational modeling and construct validation. We outline the points of convergence and divergence between them to illuminate the anatomy of a scientific theory in psychology—what a well-specified theory should contain and how it should be interrogated and revised through iterative theory-development processes. We propose how these two approaches can be used in complementary ways to increase the quality of explanations and the precision of predictions offered by psychological theories.}

abstract = {Today’s world allows people to connect over larger distances and in shorter intervals than ever before, widely monitored by massive online data sources. Ongoing worldwide computerization has led to completely new opportunities for social scientists to conceive human interactions and relations in unknown precision and quantities. However, the large data sets require techniques that are more likely to be found in computer and natural sciences than in the established fields of social relations. In order to facilitate the participation of social scientists in an emerging interdisciplinary research branch of “computational social science,” we propose in this article the usage of the Python programming language. First, we carve out its capacity to handle “Big Data” in suitable formats. Second, we introduce programming libraries to analyze large networks and big text corpora, conduct simulations, and compare their performance to their counterparts in the R environment. Furthermore, we highlight practical tools implemented in Python for operational tasks like preparing presentations. Finally, we discuss how the process of writing code may help to exemplify theoretical concepts and could lead to empirical applications that gain a better understanding of the social processes initiated by the truly global connections of the Internet era.}

abstract = {People spend most of their time indoors; therefore, maintaining a good indoor air quality and meeting the requirements of comfort and energy efficiency are essential. One of the most widespread strategies to achieve this objective is improving ventilation efficiency; therefore, the main aim of this study was to show an optimization of the ventilation efficiency, in a specific room, considering 47 variations (case studies) in the furniture arrangement. For this purpose, a numerical analysis using computational fluid dynamics techniques, validated by the tracer gas decay technique, was used to assess the distribution of the age of air within the space. The concept of “age of air” was implemented in the computational fluid dynamics code through user-defined functions, using the steady-state method based on the resolution of a transport equation for an additional scalar. Variations up to 5.75% in the ventilation efficiency between the cases studied have been achieved. It is concluded that an improvement up to 1.65% can be obtained when the elements of the study are introduced in a way that facilitates the air movement towards the exhaust; therefore, improvement of the ventilation efficiency through specific furniture distributions is possible, although not significant, according to the outcomes.}

abstract = {A numerical model based on computational fluid dynamics is developed to analyze fluid flow and thermal aspects in grinding. The model uses multiphase fluid flow with heat transfer based on the volume-of-fluid method, convection, conduction in solids and a multiple reference frame model of the porous grinding zone. Fluid velocity vectors, useful flow rate, grinding temperatures and energy partition are predicted using the model. In lieu of direct measurements of these quantities, the verification relies on the indirect assessment of surface integrity. The simulation results provide adequate agreement with the measured residual stress, depth of heat-affected zone and full width at half maximum profile with respect to the grinding temperatures.}

abstract = {Presentation of data is a major component to academic research. However, programming languages, computational tools, and methods for exploring and analyzing data can be time consuming and frustrating to learn and finding help with these stages of the broader research process can be daunting. In this work, we highlight the impacts that computational research support programs housed in library contexts can have for fulfilling gaps in student, staff, and faculty research needs. The archival history of one such organization, Software and Services for Data Science (SSDS) in the Stanford University Cecil H. Green Library, is used to outline challenges faced by social sciences and humanities researchers from the 1980s to the present day. To compliment this history, participation metrics from consulting services (1999–2021) and workshops (2000–2021) are presented along with updated workshop participant feedback forms (n = 99) and further illustrate the profound impacts that these services can have for helping researchers succeed. Consulting and workshop metrics indicate that SSDS has supported at least 27,031 researchers between 1999 and 2021 (average of more than 1175 per year). A t-test on the feedback form data indicates that participant knowledge in workshops statistically significantly increased more than one scale point from workshop start to completion. Results also indicate that despite our successes, many past challenges continue to present barriers regardless of exponential advances in computing, teaching, and learning—specifically around learning to access data and learning the software and tools to use it. We hope that our story helps other institutions understand how indispensable computational research support is within the library.}

We find differences between topics in the two periods in each of the journals’ groups and between the two groups themselves. In the European group, we find centrality of topics related to media change and media logic. In the ICA journals, we find a strengthening of scholarly engagement with effects studies.

abstract = {To evaluate thermal protective performance of fire proof garment under flash fire exposures, it is important to discuss garment heat transfer characteristics eliminating the effect of air gaps between garment and body. In this study, a test of flame manikin clothed with close-fitting garment was designed. And a three-dimensional transient heat transfer computational fluid dynamics simulation of the test was achieved to gain the garment surface temperature. By means of three-dimensional body scanner, Geomagic and Gambit software, we developed a method of three-dimensional geometrical modeling of the full-scale close-fitting clothed manikin. The accuracy of the computational fluid dynamics simulation was validated by actual experiments. It was found that the average incident heat flux to the exterior of the Nomex® IIIA garment is not 84 kW/m2, the value measured in nude manikin tests, but the value is 11% lower than it. This will help to set more accurate boundary conditions on garment surface in further simulations.}
