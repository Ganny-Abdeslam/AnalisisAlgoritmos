abstract = {A composite material (CM) of periodic structure with the peristatic properties of constituents, as proposed by Silling, is analyzed by a generalization of the classical locally elastic computational homogenization to its peristatic counterpart. New volumetric periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) are introduced at the interaction boundary of a representative unit cell (UC). A generalization of the Hill’s equality to peristatic composites is proved. The general results establishing the links between the effective moduli and the corresponding mechanical influence functions are obtained. The discretization of the equilibrium equation acts as a macro-to-micro transition of the deformation-driven type, where the overall deformation is controlled. Determination of the microstructural displacements allows one to estimate the peristatic traction at the geometrical UC’s boundary, which is exploited for estimation of the macroscopic stresses and the effective moduli. The proposed approach is demonstrated computationally through one-dimensional examples.}

abstract = {This article proposes that additional mathematical information, inherent and implicit within mathematical models of physical dynamic systems, can be extracted and visualized in a physically meaningful and useful manner as an adjunct to standard analytical modelling and solution. A conceptual methodology is given for a process of term-tracking within ordinary differential equation (ODE) models and solutions for engineering dynamics problems, and for a visualization based on a powerful new Mathematica implementation of the standard Tooltip graphical user interface facility. It is shown that the method is logical, generic, and unambiguous in its application, and that a useful visualization tool can be devised, and structured in such a way that the user can be given as much or as little information as is required to assimilate the problem to hand. The article shows by means of examples of code written expressly for the purpose that a term-tracking and visualization methodology can be constructed in a computationally effective manner within Mathematica and applied to a semi-automated variant of the method of multiple scales. It is implicitly obvious that this approach can therefore be applied to almost any algorithmic symbolic solution method, and therefore there could be physical applications which are potentially well beyond the chosen domain of non-linear engineering dynamics.}

abstract = {We address the problem of DOA estimation in positioning of nodes in wireless sensor networks. The Stochastic Maximum Likelihood (SML) algorithm is adopted in this paper. The SML algorithm is well-known for its high resolution of DOA estimation. However, its computational complexity is very high because multidimensional nonlinear optimization problem is usually involved. To reduce the computational complexity of SML estimation, we do the following work. (1) We point out the problems of conventional SML criterion and explain why and how these problems happen. (2) A local AM search method is proposed which could be used to find the local solution near/around the initial value. (3) We propose an algorithm which uses the local AM search method together with the estimation of DML or MUSIC as initial value to find the solution of SML. Simulation results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms. In particular, the algorithm which uses the local AM method and estimation of MUSIC as initial value has much higher resolution and comparable computational complexity to MUSIC.}

abstract = {Over the past few decades an enormous interest in two-phase flow in microchannels has developed because of their application in a wide range of new technologies, ranging from lab-on-a-chip devices used in medical and pharmaceutical applications to micro-structured process equipment used in many modern chemical plants. Taylor flow, in which gas bubbles are surrounded by a liquid film and separated by liquid plugs, is the most common flow regime encountered in such applications. This review introduces the important attributes of two phase flow in microchannels and then focuses on the Taylor flow regime. The existing knowledge from both experimental and computational studies is presented. Finally, perspectives for future work are suggested.}

abstract = {This paper presents a computational economics model of the property-liability insurance underwriting cycle. This computer experiment is built on downward-sloping demand, a simplistic version of the capacity constraint model of insurance supply, and a simple pricing rule. The pricing rule has each experimental insurer determine its price from the expected losses per-policy (a constant), the previous year’s policyholders’ surplus and the previous year’s number of customers. Through the use of directional bit sequences a common structure is revealed between the simulated aggregate underwriting margin and the actual aggregate underwriting margin, 1930–2000. The common structure between these aggregate variables is evidence the property-liability underwriting cycle, in a consistent effort to reach equilibrium, follows an algorithmic process. Of more general inference; the pursuit of equilibrium, as an attractor, is the only consistent characteristic of the algorithmically generated process. This algorithmic process precludes the notion of a consistent continuous probability distribution being the basis of a data generating process (DGP). The times series behavior of the simulated underwriting margin, as it fluctuates around the equilibrium attractor, can assume a variety of shapes across many realizations of the algorithmic process. Finally, behavior of the simulated individual companies is not, for the most part, correlated with the aggregate behavior, and virtually all individual transactions are out-of-equilibrium transactions in the sense that they occur along the demand curve.}

Hybrid BBLs add the ability to view and edit the block commands in auto-generated, text-based code. We compared the use of a non-hybrid BBL (Scratch), a hybrid BBL (Pencil Code), and no BBL across three sections of an introductory CS course that taught Java programming, to determine whether either type of BBL offered cognitive or affective advantages for learning Java. Students in the BBL groups were surveyed about their perceptions of each BBL in terms of ease of use and helpfulness in learning Java, and all three groups were compared on their performance in Java programming. The results showed that, in this introductory CS course, neither type of BBL offered an advantage in preparing students for learning Java. These results held regardless of the students’ level of Java knowledge prior to the course.}

abstract = {Clutter in tactical situation displays (TSD) is a persistent problem that affects pilots’ performance. Decluttering methods such as dimming, dotting, small-sizing and removal have been used in several display types to reduce clutter. This study aims to investigate the effects of different decluttering methods applied in TSD on pilots’ visual search performance. It also aims to uncover the basic psychophysical processes underlying the pilots’ visual search behavior through computational modeling. Data from fifteen Air-Force pilots showed that accuracy is higher and response time is faster when the TSD is decluttered, regardless of the technique. However, when the data was fitted into the hierarchical drift-diffusion model, it was revealed that among the techniques tested, dimming yielded the best search performance based on the model parameters. This study suggests that analyzing behavioral data through computational modeling may lead to better insights that are more practical and applicable in solving the issues in visual search in TSDs.}

abstract = {Sociologists increasingly face choices among competing algorithms that represent reasonable approaches to the same task, with little guidance in choosing among them. We develop a strategy that uses simulated data to identify the conditions under which different methods perform well and applies what is learned from the simulations to predict which method will perform best on never-before-seen empirical data sets. We apply this strategy to a class of methods that group respondents to attitude surveys according to whether they share construals of a given domain. This allows us to identify the relative strengths and weaknesses of the methods we consider, including relational class analysis, correlational class analysis, and eight other such variants. Results support the “no free lunch” view that researchers should abandon the quest for one best algorithm in favor of matching algorithms to kinds of data for which each is most appropriate and provide direction on how to do so.}

abstract = {Computational simulations based on time-dependent Ginzburg—Landau equations are used to model martensitic phase transformations induced in pressure-shear plate impact experiments. Symmetric impact experiments on polycrystalline NiTi plates, and so-called “sandwich impact” experiments on thin polycrystalline NiTi foils sandwiched between two hard plates, are simulated by characterizing each grain as a three-dimensional finite element that can transform to twinned martensite involving twenty-four habit plane variants. The threshold stress at which the transformation occurs is obtained from the amplitude of the leading shear wave in the symmetric impact experiments. The kinetic coefficient in the Ginzburg—Landau equation is obtained by matching the risetime of the transverse particle velocity in the sandwich impact experiments. These simulations highlight the importance of including the effects of self-accommodation in which clusters of several habit plane variants nucleate and grow simultaneously to reduce the constraining effect of the surrounding material.}

abstract = {In Robotics Education (RE), the hands-on experience with troubleshooting problems is seen as a good catalyst to enhance the participants’ problem-solving skills. Based on the pedagogical technique of collaborative learning and pair programming, pair learning is an emerging and potential method in RE, which means that students collaborate in pairs to construct, build, and program a robot under scripted but switchable roles. As a special collaborative learning, can pair learning also improve students’ troubleshooting performance in RE? Therefore, we conducted a comparison experiment (pair learning versus individual learning) in two classes at a Robot Summer Camp for high school students. The results indicated that (a) in the process of learning making robot artifacts, students in pair learning group (PLG) had a higher success rate in troubleshooting than that of individual learning group (ILG), but failed in other indicators and (b) in the summative test, the troubleshooting performance of students in PLG was similar with that of ILG. The findings showed that, in terms of troubleshooting, collaborative (pair) learning does not always has the superiority over individual learning in RE, which implicates other factors to be explored in future research. Implications for teaching are also discussed in this exploratory study.}
