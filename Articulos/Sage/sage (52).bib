abstract = {For industries using multi-phase transportation pipelines, erosion has been identified as one of the main challenges. Thus, extensive experimental and computational studies on slurry erosion wear have been conducted already for smooth pipes, particularly bends and junctions which were more susceptible to erosion wear because of the flow of multi-phase, but findings of erosive wear rate on the unbounded flexible pipe are not yet established. The purpose of the current study is to examine the effects of slurry wear on the unbounded flexible pipe material using CFD analysis when multi-phase fluid is flowing in the UFP at different curvature angles (30°, 50°, 70°, 90°). Flow speed (2 ms−1, 4 ms−1, 6 ms−1, 8 ms−1, 10 ms−1) and concentration (5%, 10%, 15%) were the key variables taken into account, and is discovered that these characteristics had a substantial effect on the flexible pipe. Further, to analyze how particle collision tendency affects the erosion wear rate of UPF when compared to smooth pipe, the streamlines for the UFP and smooth pipe are extracted.}

abstract = {Abstract Are we close to a complete inventory of living processes so that we might expect in the near future to reproduce every essential aspect necessary for life? Or are there mechanisms and processes in cells and organisms that are presently inaccessible to us? Here I argue that a close examination of a particularly well-understood system— that of Escherichia coli chemotaxis— shows we are still a long way from a complete description. There is a level of molecular uncertainty, particularly that responsible for fine-tuning and adaptation to myriad external conditions, which we presently cannot resolve or reproduce on a computer. Moreover, the same uncertainty exists for any process in any organism and is especially pronounced and important in higher animals such as humans. Embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, immune recognition, memory formation, and survival in the real world, all depend on vast numbers of subtle variations in cell chemistry most of which are presently unknown or only poorly characterized. Overcoming these limitations will require us to not only accumulate large quantities of highly detailed data but also develop new computational methods able to recapitulate the massively parallel processing of living cells.}

abstract = {Previous studies on inter-unit dispersion around multi-storey buildings focused mostly on an isolated building. Considering that the presence of an upstream building(s) would significantly modify the airflow pattern around a downstream building, this study intends to investigate the influence of such changed airflow patterns on inter-unit dispersion characteristics around a multi-storey building due to wind effect. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method in the framework of Reynolds-averaged Navier-stokes modelling was employed to predict the coupled outdoor and indoor airflow field, and the tracer gas technique was used to simulate the dispersion of infectious agents between units. Based on the predicted concentration field, a mass conservation based parameter, namely re-entry ratio, was used to evaluate quantitatively the inter-unit dispersion possibilities and thus assess risks along different routes. The presence of upstream building(s) could disrupt the strong impingement of approaching flows but brings a more complex and irregular airflow pattern around the downstream multi-storey buildings, leading to a more scattered distribution of re-entry ratio values among different units and uncertain dispersion routes. Generally, the tracer gas concentration in most units was lower than those in an isolated building, although very high concentrations were found in some specific areas.}

abstract = {Different geometry patterns of the surface of thrust bearings have been proven very beneficial in terms of bearing load-carrying capacity and friction coefficient. In this study, four different types of sector-pad thrust bearings have been cross-evaluated for operation under realistic operating conditions: (a) an open pocket bearing, (b) a closed pocket bearing, (c) a tapered-land bearing, and (d) a bearing partially textured with rectangular dimples. Bearing performance has been computed by means of computational fluid dynamics simulations based on the numerical solution of the Navier–Stokes and energy equations for incompressible flow. Conjugate heat transfer at the bearing pad and rotor has been taken into account. Initially, for a reference design of each bearing, the effects of varying rotational speed and minimum film thickness have been investigated. Further, characterization of each bearing for a constant level of thrust load has been performed. Finally, the effects of varying the depth of each geometry pattern have been studied. The present results illustrate a superior performance of the open pocket bearing in comparison to the other bearing types.}

abstract = {The extent of inter-material mixing and the formation of intermetallic compounds play a critical role in the structural integrity and mechanical properties of the joints in the case of dissimilar metal friction stir welding. In general, there is a critical volume fraction of the intermetallic compounds in the mix zone of the friction stir welding-joint at which the mechanical properties of the joint are maximized. That is, insufficient inter-material mixing and the accompanying sub-critical volume fraction of the intermetallic compounds results in insufficient inter-material bonding and inferior joint strength. Conversely, super-critical volume fraction of the intermetallic compounds typically gives rise to the joint embrittlement. To address the problem of the effect of the friction stir welding process parameters on the extent of intermetallic compound formation, a multi-physics computational framework has been developed and applied to the case of dissimilar metal friction stir welding involving commercially pure (CP) aluminum and AISI 1005 low-carbon steel. The multi-physics framework comprises the following main modules: (a) finite-element-based friction stir welding-process modeling; (b) quantum-mechanics, atomistic and CALPHAD-type continuum material thermodynamics analyses of the intermetallic compound-nucleation process; (c) a continuum-type analysis of multi-component diffusion-controlled growth of the intermetallic compounds; and (d) Kolmogorov–Johnson–Mehl–Avrami type analysis of the evolution of the intermetallic compound volume fraction within the friction stir welding joint as a function of the friction stir welding process parameters. The results obtained revealed that: (i) the extent and the spatial distribution of the intermetallic compounds is a sensitive function of the friction stir welding-process parameters; and (ii) among the six potential Al-Fe intermetallic compounds, FeAl and Fe3Al are associated with the largest volume fractions and, hence, play a key role in both attaining the required joint strength and in the potential loss of the joint fracture toughness.}

In one of the first studies of its kind, we assess how this practice was effectuated during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We use computational analysis to determine the polarity, subjectivity and use of some linguistics features in the status messages of 140,359 Facebook posts of 17 mainstream and alternative news titles from Flanders (Belgium) between March 2020 and 2021. Among other things, we find that status messages score considerably higher than headlines in terms of polarity and subjectivity, and that they, along with the use of question and interrogation marks, peaked in the first months of the pandemic. We contextualise our findings within existing scholarship and wider trends in increasingly digitised and globalised media societies.}

Yet, no research has examined the extent to which information-processing, literacy, numeracy, and problem-solving skills in technologically rich environments may associate with having a STEM degree for various disability populations. This study analyzed the United States nationally representative data from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) to examine associations between adult skills and having a STEM degree for people with and without disabilities. No direct associations were found between adult skills and having a STEM degree for people with learning disabilities or for people without disabilities. These groups’ information processing, literacy, numeracy, and problem-solving skills were not determining factors in STEM degree attainment. However, findings suggest a significant association between problem-solving skills and having a STEM degree for people with visual and/or hearing impairments. Policy implications are discussed.}

abstract = {This exciting and original book describes the work of David Marr and his colleagues at MIT on the computational theory of vision, particularly the early stages of shape analysis. Although much of the theorising is frankly speculative and not certain to survive without major modification, it sets new standards of rigour in its formal approach and is certain to have a stimulating effect upon the field. Sadly, Marr’s death from leukaemia at the age of 35 means that he will not himself be able to take part in the further development of his ideas, but the book itself will exert an important influence for some time to come. The first point to make, for those who may already have attempted Marr’s lengthy and difficult research papers, is that the book is clearly and entertainingly written: It can be tackled by the non-specialist who wishes to see why Marr’s work has caused such interest in the vision community. Despite the very difficult circumstances in which the book must have been written, it is carefully put together and gives a fascinating insight into the way in which the author’s ideas developed.}

The framework suggests that data literacy is the dominant principle underlying a shift in professional practice, accentuated by an understanding of computational science, statistical methodology, and data-adjacent domain knowledge. A combination of new and existing skills meshed into public administration curriculums help implement these principles and advance public administration education.}

abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is an indispensable simulation tool for predicting the emission of pollutants in the work environment. Welding is one of the most common industrial processes that might expose the operators and surrounding workers to certain hazardous gaseous metal fumes. In the present study, we used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology for simulating the emission of iron fumes from the shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) procedure. A galvanized steel chamber was fabricated to measure the pollutant concentration and identify the size of the fume created by the SMAW. Then, the emission of welding aerosol was simulated using a method of computational fluid-particle dynamics with the ANSYS 2020 R1 software. The highest amount of welding fumes concentration was related to iron fumes (i.e., 3045 μg/m3 with a diameter of 0.25 μm). The results of the current study indicated that the local exhaust and general ventilation system can prevent the spreading of welding fumes to the welder’s breathing zone and the surrounding environment. CFD was also found to be an efficient method for predicting the emission of the iron fumes created by SMAW as well as for selecting an appropriate ventilation system. However, further studies that take the modeling of welding-generated emission of additional metal particles and gases into account will need to be undertaken.}
