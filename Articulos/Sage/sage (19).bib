abstract = {The 10th annual International Conference of Students of Systematic Musicology (SysMus) took place on September 13–15, 2017, at Queen Mary University of London (UoL). The SysMus series has established itself as an international, student-run conference series aimed at introducing graduate students to networking and discussing their work in an academic conference environment. The term “Systematic Musicology,” first coined by Guido Adler (1885), nowadays covers a wide range of systematic or empirical approaches to theoretical, psychological, neuroscientific, ethnographic, and computational methodologies in music research. Presentations for SysMus17 focused on three central topics in relation to music: cognition and neuroscience, computation, and health and well-being. Each of these topics was the subject of workshops as well as keynotes by Prof. Lauren Stewart (Goldsmiths University of London and Music in the Brain Centre, Aarhus University), Prof. Elaine Chew and Dr. Marcus Pearce (both Queen Mary UoL), Dr. Daniel Müllensiefen (Goldsmiths UoL), and Prof. Aaron Williamon (Royal College of Music). Further presentations addressed issues relating to harmony and rhythm, musicians and performance, music and emotion, and sociology of music. This year’s conference brought together early-career researchers from the fields of musicology, psychology, and medicine, allowing them to socialize, share their work, and gain insight into interdisciplinary approaches to their subjects. SysMus17 was organized by students at Queen Mary’s Music Cognition Lab and was particularly marked by the series’ 10th anniversary, the live streaming of all presentations via social media, and a carbon-offsetting Green Initiative. The proceedings of SysMus17 will be available on demand from the conference website (www.sysmus17.qmul.ac.uk) and the videos will be made available for public access.}

abstract = {In our contemporary moment, when machine learning algorithms are reshaping many aspects of society, the work of N. Katherine Hayles stands as a powerful corpus for understanding what is at stake in a new regime of computation. A renowned literary theorist whose work bridges the humanities and sciences among her many works, Hayles has detailed ways to think about embodiment in an age of virtuality (How We Became Posthuman, 1999), how code as performative practice is located (My Mother Was a Computer, 2005), and the reciprocal relations among human bodies and technics (How We Think, 2012). This special issue follows the 2017 publication of her book Unthought: The Power of the Cognitive Nonconscious, in which Hayles traces the nonconscious cognition of biological life-forms and computational media. The articles in the special issue respond in different ways to Hayles’ oeuvre, mapping the specific contours of computational regimes and developing some of the ‘inflection points’ she advocates in the deep engagement with technical systems.}

abstract = {Cement augmentation in vertebrae (vertebroplasty) is usually used to restore mechanical strength after spinal fracture but could also be used as a prophylactic treatment. So far, the mechanical competence has been determined immediately post-treatment, without considering long-term effects of bone adaptation. In this work, we investigated such long-term effects of vertebroplasty on the stiffness of the augmented bone by means of computational simulation of bone adaptation. Using micro-finite element analysis, we determined sites of increased mechanical stress (stress raisers) and stress shielding and, based on the simulations, regions with increased or decreased bone loss due to augmentation. Cement volumes connecting the end plates led to increased stress shielding and bone loss. The increased stiffness due to the augmentation, however, remained constant over the simulation time of 30 years. If the intervention was performed at an earlier time point, it did lead to more bone loss, but again, it did not affect long-term stability as this loss was compensated by bone gains in other areas. In particular, around the augmentation cement, bone structures were preserved, suggesting a long-term integration of the cement in the augmented bone. We conclude that, from a biomechanical perspective, the impact of vertebroplasty on the bone at the microstructural level is less detrimental than previously thought.}

abstract = {Scientific knowledge, ideally neutral and impartial, is inevitably shaped by geographical, economic, and cultural contexts. This research contends that overcoming the constraints of human and economic scarcity, inertia, and limited funding access demands development of collaborative research networks. To this end, four university laboratories from Brazil and Chile - UFRJ, UBB, UTFSM and UAI - have united to advance robotics applied to architecture. The methodology begins with an analysis of Industry 4.0, Fab Lab implementations, and robotics in architecture in the region. They identify key research aspects by mapping each laboratory’s activities and technologies to pinpoint expertise and potential collaborative areas. The authors propose a summary table comparing the labs and a chronological overview to track regional robotics advancement. To raise awareness among peers, the initiative involves joint actions such as courses, workshops and technical visits.1 Recognising the scarcity of robotic units and the inapplicability of procedures from wealthier contexts, the authors draw on their lab experience to propose guidelines for implementing robotics research units in academia within the region. This includes technological alternatives, installation considerations, and detailed configuration reviews. The deployment of additional robotic units is a means to foster collaboration and bolster the network. Anticipated outcomes encompass increased critical mass, collaborative research initiatives, faculty and student exchange across institutions, higher publication rates, knowledge acquisition, and improved access to global funding agencies. In summary, the Southern Creative Robotics network initiative aims to catalyse the creative integration of digital manufacturing and robotics technology within design in the Ibero-American context.}

abstract = {In the fourth industrial revolution, programming promises to be a fundamental subject like mathematics, science, languages ​​or the arts. Architects design more than buildings developing innovative methods and they are among the pioneers in visual programming development. However, after more than 10 years of visual programming in architecture, despite the fast-learning curve, visual programming presents considerable limitations to solve complex problems. To overcome limitations, the authors propose to associate the advantages of visual and textual languages in Python. The article addresses an ongoing research study to implement Computational Methods in Architectural Education. The authors began by describing the general goal of this project, and of this article in particular. This article focuses on the implementation of two disciplines ‘Computation for Architecture in Python’ I and II. The first discipline uses programming based on the construction of functions in the imperative language, implemented in the text editor, in visual programming, using Grasshopper methods. The second discipline, which is under development, intends to teach object-oriented programming. The results of the first discipline are encouraging; despite reported difficulties in programming fundamentals, such as lists, loops and recursion. The development of the second discipline, in object-oriented programming, deals with the concepts of classes and objects, and more abstract principles such abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism or encapsulation. This paradigm allows building robust programs, but requires a more in-depth syntax. The article reports this ongoing research on this new paradigm of object-oriented language, expanding the application of a hybrid visual-textual language in Architecture.}

abstract = {With the release of the consensus report English Learners in STEM Subjects: Transforming Classrooms, Schools, and Lives, we highlight foundational constructs and perspectives associated with STEM subjects and language with English learners (ELs) that frame the report. The purpose here is to elevate these constructs and perspectives for discussion among the broader education research community. First, we provide an overview of the unique contributions of the report to move the ELs and STEM fields forward. Second, we describe ELs in terms of their heterogeneity and the inconsistency of educational policies that affect their learning opportunities in STEM subjects. Third, we describe contemporary views on STEM subjects and language with ELs that indicate that instructional shifts across STEM subjects and language are mutually supportive. Fourth, we describe promising instructional strategies to promote STEM learning and language development with ELs. Lastly, we close the article by reimagining STEM education with ELs and offer potential next steps. These foundational constructs and perspectives on STEM subjects and language with ELs are critical because they provide the conceptual grounding for the design of the education system for ELs. The report could contribute to building a knowledge base for ELs in STEM subjects and language as education research, policy, and practice converge to reimagine what is possible to both support and challenge ELs to learn academically rigorous content standards that are expected of all students.}

abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics is taught in many universities and is a trending elective option among engineering students. Although analyzing computational fluid dynamics simulations is exciting enough, the theory is equation intensive, sometimes very abstract and also difficult to visualize for the novice. A creative thinking based approach termed synectics, which involves analogies, was therefore applied in classroom teaching to increase student comfort with the equations. For this purpose six analogies encompassing basic computational fluid dynamics concepts were developed along with pictorial representations, and are presented in this work. These analogies were integrated into classroom teaching via synectics procedures. Student feedback was positive and reflected higher engagement with the course compared to when the metaphoric activity was not implemented. This work attempts to demonstrate the feasibility and value of applying creative techniques, even when teaching a highly structured and equation oriented course such as computational fluid dynamics.}
