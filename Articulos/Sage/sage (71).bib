abstract = {Current web-based visualizations are designed for single computers and cannot make use of additional devices on the client side, even if today’s users often have access to several, such as a tablet, a smartphone, and a smartwatch. We present a framework for ad hoc computational clusters that leverage these local devices for visualization computations. Furthermore, we present an instantiating JavaScript toolkit called VisHive for constructing web-based visualization applications that can transparently connect multiple devices—called cells—into such ad hoc clusters—called a hive—for local computation. Hives are formed either using a matchmaking service or through manual configuration. Cells are organized into a master–slave architecture, where the master provides the visual interface to the user and controls the slaves and the slaves perform computation. VisHive is built entirely using current web technologies, runs in the native browser of each cell, and requires no specific software to be downloaded on the involved devices. We demonstrate VisHive using four distributed examples: a text analytics visualization, a database query for exploratory visualization, a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise clustering running on multiple nodes, and a principal component analysis implementation.}

abstract = {Flow boiling in microchannels has received enormous interest in academic research over the past few decades because of its importance in the thermal management of micro-structured devices. A vast number of experimental and theoretical studies have been reported and an increasing number of computational studies of microchannel flow boiling have been performed in the past few years. This article provides a review of the previous studies of flow boiling in microchannels, with a focus on the computational work. We present the governing equations, boundary conditions, numerical methods and the mathematical treatment of phase change used. Some important numerical studies are reviewed in detail and their strengths and weaknesses are presented. Finally, a summary of the current status of modelling in this area is provided.}

abstract = {Research shows charter schools are more segregated by race and class than are traditional public schools. I investigate an underexamined mechanism for this segregation: Charter schools project identities corresponding to parents’ race- and class-specific parenting styles and educational values. I use computational text analysis to detect the emphasis on inquiry-based learning in the websites of all charter schools operating in 2015–16. I then estimate mixed linear regression models to test the relationships between ideological emphasis and school- and district-level poverty and ethnicity. I thereby transcend methodological problems in scholarship on charter school identities by collecting contemporary, populationwide data and by blending text analysis with hypothesis testing. Findings suggest charter school identities are both race and class specific, outlining a new mechanism by which school choice may consolidate parents by race and class—and paving the way for behavioral and longitudinal studies. This project contributes to literatures on school choice and educational stratification.}

abstract = {Abstract Analysis of metabolic networks typically begins with construction of the stoichiometry matrix, which characterizes the network topology. This matrix provides, via the balance equation, a description of the potential steady-state flow distribution. This paper begins with the observation that the balance equation depends only on the structure of linear redundancies in the network, and so can be stated in a succinct manner, leading to computational efficiencies in steady-state analysis. This alternative description of steady-state behaviour is then used to provide a novel method for network reduction, which complements existing algorithms for describing intracellular networks in terms of input-output macro-reactions (to facilitate bioprocess optimization and control). Finally, it is demonstrated that this novel reduction method can be used to address elementary mode analysis of large networks: the modes supported by a reduced network can capture the input-output modes of a metabolic module with significantly reduced computational effort.}

abstract = {Individuals with autism spectrum disorder demonstrate narrative (i.e. storytelling) difficulties which can significantly impact their ability to form and maintain social relationships. However, existing research has not comprehensively documented these impairments in more open-ended, emotionally evocative situations common to daily interactions. Computational linguistic measures offer a promising complement to traditional hand-coding methods of narrative analysis and in this study were applied together with hand coding of narratives elicited with emotionally salient scenes from the Thematic Apperception Test. In total, 19 individuals with autism spectrum disorder and 14 typically developing controls were asked to tell stories about six images from the Thematic Apperception Test. Both structural and qualitative aspects of narrative were assessed using a hand-coding system and Latent Semantic Analysis, an automated computational measure of semantic similarity. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder demonstrated significant difficulties with the use of complex syntax to integrate their narratives and problems explaining characters’ intentions. These and other key narrative skills were strongly related to narrative competence scores derived from Latent Semantic Analysis, which also distinguished the autism spectrum disorder group from controls. Together, results underscore key narrative impairments in autism spectrum disorder and support the promise of Latent Semantic Analysis as a valuable tool for the quantitative assessment of complex language abilities.}

abstract = {A computational model of attention and situation awareness (SA) was developed and used to predict pilot errors in the task of taxiing from runway to terminal. The model incorporates a low-level perception/attention module and a higher-level belief-updating module. Attentional scanning is controlled by bottom-up and top-down processes, with the effectiveness of top-down guidance varying as a function of SA. Information sampled by the low-level module is fed forward to the higher-level module for consolidation within a working memory representation of the pilot’s situation, with the quality of this representation reflecting the pilot’s level of SA. The model was validated by comparing its predictions to the behavior of pilots performing a taxiway simulation. Results indicate that the model successfully predicts the improved performance associated with display augmentations, and provides construct validity regarding the effects of visibility, distraction, and degraded information quality.}

abstract = {This article takes inspiration from Kittler’s claim that philosophy has neglected the means used for its production. Kittler’s argument for media ontology will be compared to the post-Kantian project of re-inventing philosophy through the medium of thought (in particular Deleuze’s Spiritual Automaton). The article discusses these views in the context of the automation of logical thinking where procedures, tasks, and functions are part of the instrumental processing of new ends evolving a new mode of reasoning. In particular, the article suggests that in constructivist logic and information theory, the temporal gap between truth and proof, between input and output, can be taken to argue that the means of thought expose the indetermination or the incomputability of proof. The automation of reasoning in logical processing coincides not with mindless correlations of data, replacing axioms with data, truths with self-validating proofs. Instead, the problem of the indeterminacy of proof within automated logic re-habilitates techne or instrumentality, and the relation between means and ends away from classical idealism and analytic realism. By following John Dewey’s argument for instrumentality, it will be argued that the task of thinking today needs to re-invent a logic of techne away from the teleological view of ends or the crisis of finality. If the post-Kantian preoccupations about the task of thinking already announced that the medium of thought could offer possibilities for a non-human philosophy (or a philosophy beyond truth), this article envisions a machine philosophy originating from within computational media.}

abstract = {How robust is a healthcare system? How does a patient navigate the system and what is the cost (e.g., number of medical services required or number of times the medical provider had to be changed to get access to the required medical services) incurred from the first symptoms to getting cured? How will it fare in the wake to a sudden epidemic or a disaster? How are all of these affected by administrative decisions such as allocating/diminishing resources in various areas or centralising services? These are the questions motivating our study on a formal prototype model for a healthcare system. We propose that a healthcare system can be understood as a distributed system with independent nodes (healthcare providers) computing according to their own resources and constraints, with tasks (patient needs) being allocated between the nodes. The questions about the healthcare system become in this context questions about resource availability and distribution between the nodes. We construct in this paper an Event-B model capturing the basic functionality of a simplified healthcare system: patients with different types of medical needs being allocated to suitable medical providers, and navigating between different providers for their turn for multi-step treatments.}

abstract = {Molecular biology focuses on genes and their interactions at the transcription, regulation and protein level. Finding genes that cause certain behaviors can make therapeutic interventions more effective. Although biological tools can extract the genes and perform some analyses, without the help of computational methods, deep insight of the genetic function and its effects will not occur. On the other hand, complex systems can be modeled by networks, introducing the main data as nodes and the links in-between as the transactions occurring within the network. Gene regulatory networks are examples that are modeled and analyzed in order to gain insight of their exact functions. Since a cell’s specific functionality is greatly determined by the genes it expresses, translation or the act of converting mRNA to proteins is highly regulated by the control network that directs cellular activities. This paper briefly reviews the most important computational methods for analyzing, modeling and controlling the gene regulatory networks.}
