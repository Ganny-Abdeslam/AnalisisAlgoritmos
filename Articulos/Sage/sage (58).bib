abstract = {This investigation assessed the extent to which elementary-age learning disabled students were able to generalize a computational skill. The subjects consisted of nine students, all of whom made systematic errors in arithmetic. Two experiments were conducted using within-subject designs. All students experienced baseline, demonstration and modeling plus feedback, and maintenance. Students who met criteria for generalizing proceeded to a followup condition, while those who did not received further interventions designed to increase their ability to generalize. The effectiveness of the following procedures was investigated: (a) reinforcing students “to generalize,” and (b) a technique which combined training several response exemplars with the use of a verbal cue and an in-discriminable reinforcement contingency. The results indicated that demonstration and modeling plus feedback was sufficient to increase some students’ ability to generalize; others required further interventions to facilitate generalization.}

abstract = {The development of large medium-speed catamarans aims increasing economic viability and reducing the possible negative influence on the environment of fast sea transportation. These vessels are likely to operate at hump speed where wave-making can be the dominating component of the total resistance. Shallow water may considerably amplify the wave-making and hence the overall drag force. Computational fluid dynamics is used to predict the drag force of medium-speed catamarans at model and full scale in infinite and restricted water to study the impact on the resistance. Steady and unsteady shallow-water effects that occur in model testing or full-scale operation are taken into account using computational fluid dynamics as they are inherently included in the mathematical formulations. Unsteady effects in the ship-model response were recorded in model test experiments, computational fluid dynamics simulations and full-scale measurements and found to agree with each other. For a medium-speed catamaran in water that is restricted in width and depth, it was found that computational fluid dynamics is capable of accurately predicting the drag with a maximum deviation of no more than 6% when compared to experimental results in model scale. The influences of restricted depth and width were studied using computational fluid dynamics where steady finite width effects in shallow water and finite depth effects at finite width were quantified. Full-scale drag from computational fluid dynamics predictions in shallow water (h/L = 0.12 – 0.17) was found to be between full-scale measurements and extrapolated model test results. Finally, it is shown that current extrapolation procedures for shallow-water model tests over-estimate residuary resistance by up to 12% and underestimate frictional forces by up to 35% when compared to validated computational fluid dynamics results. This study concludes that computational fluid dynamics is a versatile tool to predict the full-scale ship resistance to a more accurate extent than extrapolation model test data and can also be utilised to estimate model sizes that keep finite-water effects to an agreed minimum.}

This analysis can be used to explain the experimental findings from subject experiments and to evaluate the workload trade-offs between primary and secondary driving tasks.}

abstract = {Application of computational fluid dynamics to real steam flows including non-equilibrium condensing flows requires an accurate and, at the same time, computationally inexpensive formulation of thermodynamic properties of steam. The present formulation enables fast computation of all thermodynamic properties, using mass density and specific internal energy as independent variables. This choice of independent variables follows the needs of time-marching computational fluid dynamics computations of dry and metastable steam flows in steam turbines. The formulation comprises an ideal-gas part and a residual part. The residual part is expressed in a form analogous to the virial equation of state but the coefficients are functions of internal energy, rather than temperature. Here we present a variant retaining only one coefficient of the density series, corresponding to the second virial coefficient. The uncertainties of properties computed from the present formulation only slightly exceed those of the fundamental formulation IAPWS-95. The formulation is valid from 253.15 K to 1073.15 K. Up to pressures given by the isentrope 7.5 kJ/(kg K), the computed properties are within the experimental uncertainties. Beyond this limit, the accuracy continuously decreases as it can be determined from presented deviation plots.}

abstract = {Rigidity of thought is considered a main characteristic of persons with Asperger syndrome (AS). This rigidity may explain the poor comprehension of unusual semantic relations, frequently exhibited by persons with AS. Research indicates that such deficiency is related to altered mental lexicon organization, but has never been directly examined. The present study used computational network science tools to compare the mental lexicon structure of persons with AS and matched controls. Persons with AS and matched controls generated free associations, and network tools were used to extract and compare the mental lexicon structure of the two groups. The analysis revealed that persons with AS exhibit a hyper-modular semantic organization: their mental lexicon is more compartmentalized compared to matched controls. We argue that this hyper-modularity may be related to the rigidity of thought which characterizes persons with AS and discuss the clinical and more general cognitive implications of our findings.}

abstract = {Background: There is increasing evidence from animal and clinical studies that network hyperexcitability (NH) may be an important pathophysiological process and potential target for treatment in early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Measures of functional connectivity (FC) have been proposed as promising biomarkers for NH, but it is unknown which measure has the highest sensitivity for early-stage changes in the excitation/inhibition balance. Objective: We aim to test the performance of different FC measures in detecting NH at the earliest stage using a computational approach. Methods: We use a whole brain computational model of activity dependent degeneration to simulate progressive AD pathology and NH. We investigate if and at what stage four measures of FC (amplitude envelope correlation corrected [AECc], phase lag index [PLI], joint permutation entropy [JPE] and a new measure: phase lag time [PLT]) can detect early-stage AD pathophysiology. Results: The activity dependent degeneration model replicates spectral changes in line with clinical data and demonstrates increasing NH. Compared to relative theta power as a gold standard the AECc and PLI are shown to be less sensitive in detecting early-stage NH and AD-related neurophysiological abnormalities, while the JPE and the PLT show more sensitivity with excellent test characteristics. Conclusions: Novel FC measures, which are better in detecting rapid fluctuations in neural activity and connectivity, may be superior to well-known measures such as the AECc and PLI in detecting early phase neurophysiological abnormalities and in particular NH in AD. These markers could improve early diagnosis and treatment target identification.}

abstract = {Current theories of artificial intelligence (AI) generally exclude human emotions. The idea at the core of such theories could be described as ‘cognition is computing’; that is, that human psychological and symbolic representations and the operations involved in structuring such representations in human thinking and intelligence can be converted by AI into a series of cognitive symbolic representations and calculations in a manner that simulates human intelligence. However, after decades of development, the cognitive computing doctrine has encountered many difficulties, both in theory and in practice; in particular, it is far from approaching real human intelligence. Real human intelligence runs through the whole process of the emotions. The core and motivation of rational thinking are derived from the emotions. Intelligence without emotion neither exists nor is meaningful. For example, the idea of ‘hot thinking’ proposed by Paul Thagard, a philosopher of cognitive science, discusses the mechanism of the emotions in human cognition and the thinking process. Through an analysis from the perspectives of cognitive neurology, cognitive psychology and social anthropology, this article notes that there may be a type of thinking that could be called ‘emotional thinking’. This type of thinking includes complex emotional factors during the cognitive processes. The term is used to refer to the capacity to process information and use emotions to integrate information in order to arrive at the right decisions and reactions. This type of thinking can be divided into two types according to the role of cognition: positive and negative emotional thinking. That division reflects opposite forces in the cognitive process. In the future, ‘emotional computing’ will cause an important acceleration in the development of AI consciousness. The foundation of AI consciousness is emotional computing based on the simulation of emotional thinking.}
