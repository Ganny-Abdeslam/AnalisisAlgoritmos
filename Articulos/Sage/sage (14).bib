abstract = {The Faculty of Digital and Computational Studies (DCS) at Bowdoin College proposes a critical, analytical framework, referred to as the ‘4As,’ as an interdisciplinary means to interpret, evaluate, and create the data, operations, and devices of computing across all domains of knowledge production. Following other disciplines that have developed in symbiotic relationships to one another, DCS puts computation in conversation with fields from across the arts, humanities, physical, and social sciences. Our foundational premise is the bidirectional influence between these disciplines and digital artifacts and computation. The 4As (artifact, architecture, abstraction, and agency) benefit from both the scepticism of the liberal arts in the face of ubiquitous digital processes and the analytical opening for examining questions pertaining to creative and imaginative alternatives to the digital and computational status quo. We provide an ultra-contemporary case study to demonstrate the framework in use.}

abstract = {With the introduction and implementation of core literacy, scientific thinking (ST) has become an essential goal and key dimension of science teaching. At present, there is no agreement on how to cultivate students’ ST. This study took 238 sixth grade students from a public primary school in urban China as research sample, built a theoretical model of scientific thinking development based on the theory of the Bronfenbrenner’ ecological systems theory, and used multiple data to explore and analyze the impact path of ST development of primary school students using the fuzzy sets of qualitative comparative analysis method (fsQCA). The development of urban primary school students’ ST is the result of multiple factors at the level of individual drive, family environment, school teaching, and social resources. The result of data analysis showed that the influence path of ST development of urban primary school students driven by multiple factors includes three paths: parent participation leading, scientific practice leading, and home-school-community integration. We have interpreted the influence mechanism of each path in detail and put forward the enlightenment for science education policy and practice.}

abstract = {This article reflects on how the ingression of computation in culture has not only transformed media into algorithmic devices but has also, more importantly, led to the automation of the most precious faculty of the human, namely, reasoning. This article problematizes the tout court refusal of algorithmic thinking as thinking and suggests that we are witnessing the advance of a dynamic form of automated reasoning, exposing the limits of the critical approach toward the calculative. The article points out that the alliance between algorithmic automation and the digital infrastructure of neoliberalism is not without significance, but attention must be paid to the specific posthuman form of cognitive capitalism.}

abstract = {While a small number of school districts across the United States are well into the process of implementing system-wide computer science education (CSed), most districts are only just getting started. But what does it look like to “get started” on CSed for a whole district? This manuscript presents a single case study of a district’s process of initiating their CS instructional initiative, highlighting a distinct set of instructional leadership practices and the institutional conditions they were responding to. Early implementation research around CSed shows that in some districts, leadership practices are less often the focus of early activities. This study sheds light on what such leadership practices can look like in the early stages of a district’s CSed initiative. Our analysis, based on qualitative data collected longitudinally over 18 months of the district’s work, identified eight intertwined leadership practices that aimed to support instructional coherence, and in our findings, we share a narrative of the district’s initiation of its CS initiative around them. The case begins with the (1) initial leadership team formation and details how that team engaged in (2) content-specific instructional capacity building for its members and (3) sensemaking of ideas around CS with their relationship to existing district activities. It moves on to the team’s (4) development of an instructional vision and an (5) associated implementation strategy, which fed into processes of (6) sensegiving to foster buy-in among teachers, and providing encouragement to engage in (7) instructional piloting. Finally, leaders engaged in (8) landscape analysis activities in order to understand existing district resources and teacher perceptions related to CS. Throughout the case, we highlight the motivations behind these practices, what resources they drew on, intersections, and dependencies among them. We close our analysis exploring a number of tensions and unintended consequences associated with these leadership activities.}

abstract = {This paper reports the recent development and implementation of three teaching modules in order to teach and enhance the students’ critical thinking skills in a level IV undergraduate/postgraduate course ‘Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for Engineering Applications’. These teaching modules include a lecture module, an online test module and a CFD project module. The lecture module introduces the importance of critical thinking skills by an example case, critical thinking definition and processes, and the application of critical thinking skills in formulation of CFD problems. In the online test module, seven online tests have been developed to enhance the students’ understanding of the contents of lectures and practical sessions. Meanwhile, students apply their critical thinking skills to work out some of the tests. In the project module, a student-driven CFD project is designed to help students to apply CFD techniques and critical thinking skills in engineering problems. In the project, students choose their own project topic and problems. They use CFD skills learned in the course and critical thinking skills to critically analyse their problems, identify the important parameters and review results. They apply the critical writing skills to finalise a project report. To the best knowledge of the author, this systematical integration of teaching and enhancement of critical thinking skills in computational fluid dynamics course is innovative. Feedback from students is quite positive shown by an anonymous survey in 2014.}

We present the results of a case study based on a 7-day workshop with 10 participants with landscape design and architecture background. The goal of the workshop was to expose participants to Data-driven Thinking through experimental design, multi-sensor data collection, data analysis, visualization, and insight generation. We evaluate their learning experience in designing an experimental setup, collecting real-time immediate environmental and physiological body reactions data. Our results from the workshop show that participants increased their knowledge about measuring, visualizing and understanding data of the surrounding built environment.}

abstract = {Coupled with the ‘smart city’, the idea of the ‘smart school’ is emerging in imaginings of the future of education. Various commercial, governmental and civil society organizations now envisage education as a highly coded, software-mediated and data-driven social institution. Such spaces are to be governed through computational processes written in computer code and tracked through big data. In an original analysis of developments from commercial, governmental and civil society sectors, the article examines two interrelated dimensions of an emerging smart schools imaginary: (1) the constant flows of digital data that smart schools depend on and the mobilization of analytics that enable student data to be used to anticipate and shape their behaviours; and (2) the ways that young people are educated to become ‘computational operatives’ who must ‘learn to code’ in order to become ‘smart citizens’ in the governance of the smart city. These developments constitute an emerging educational space fabricated from intersecting standards, technologies, discourses and social actors, all infused with the aspirations of technical experts to govern the city at a distance through both monitoring young people as ‘data objects’ and schooling them as active ‘computational citizens’ with the responsibility to compute the future of the city.}
