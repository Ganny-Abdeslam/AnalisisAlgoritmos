abstract = {A computational means to assess the conspicuity of highway features was developed, verified, and then applied to a sample construction work zone scene. This work was conceived as a balance between modeling the complex phenomena within the human visual system and the need for a simple applications-oriented tool for practitioners to derive a quantitative relative assessment of real-world construction work zones to rank choices in terms of conspicuity. The results indicate that the vision model–based tool can assess the relative conspicuity of individual elements of a roadway or roadside scene and is relatively straightforward in use. As such, it holds potential value in virtual prototyping of work-zone sight lines, colors, and placement of hazard warning cues, such as cones, markings, and reflective vests.}

abstract = {TikTok has emerged as a powerful platform for the dissemination of mis- and disinformation about the war in Ukraine. During the initial three months after the Russian invasion in February 2022, videos under the hashtag #Ukraine garnered 36.9 billion views, with individual videos scaling up to 88 million views. Beyond the traditional methods of spreading misleading information through images and text, the medium of sound has emerged as a novel, platform-specific audiovisual technique. Our analysis distinguishes various war-related sounds utilized by both Ukraine and Russia and classifies them into a mis- and disinformation typology. We use computational propaganda features—automation, scalability, and anonymity—to explore how TikTok’s auditory practices are exploited to exacerbate information disorders in the context of ongoing war events. These practices include reusing sounds for coordinated campaigns, creating audio meme templates for rapid amplification and distribution, and deleting the original sounds to conceal the orchestrators’ identities. We conclude that TikTok’s recommendation system (the “for you” page) acts as a sound space where exposure is strategically navigated through users’ intervention, enabling semi-automated “soft” propaganda to thrive by leveraging its audio features.}

abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been widely adopted to identify the Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the construction industry and determine its high environmental impact through Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, energy and resource consumptions. The consideration of LCA in the early stages of design is becoming increasingly important as a means to avoid costly changes at later stages of the project. However, typical LCA-based tools demand very detailed information about structural and material systems and thus become too laborious for designers in the conceptual stages, where such specifications are still loosely defined. In response, this paper presents a workflow for LCA-based evaluation where the selection of the construction system and material is kept open to compare the impacts of alternative design variants. We achieve this through a strict division into support and infill systems and a simplified visualization of a schematic floor layout using a shoebox approach, inspired from the energy modelling domain. The shoeboxes in our case are repeatable modules within a schematic floor plan layout, whose enclosures are defined by parametric 2D surfaces representing total ratios of permanent supports versus infill components. Thus, the assembly of modular surface enclosures simplifies the LCA evaluation process by avoiding the need to accurately specify the physical properties of each building component across the floor plan. The presented workflow facilitates the selection of alternative structural systems and materials for their comparison, and outputs the Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the form of an intuitive visualization output. The workflow for simplified evaluation is illustrated through a case study that compares the GWP for selected combinations of material choice and construction systems.}

abstract = {We investigate a new approach for characterizing class separability based on topological measures for use with identifying flaw severity in plates. Multi-mode Lamb waves are propagated across a flat-bottom hole of varying depth. Lamb wave tomography reconstructions are first generated to locate and size the flaw at each depth. As the flaw depth increases, scattering and mode conversion effects dominate the raw time-domain signals, obscuring information about flaw severity. Pattern classification provides an alternate means for processing the ultrasonic waveforms to identify flaw severity. High-dimensional feature spaces are generated from the Lamb wave signals using the dynamic wavelet fingerprinting technique. In order to achieve high classification accuracy, an optimal feature space is required. An intelligent feature selection routine is explored here that identifies favorable class distributions in multidimensional feature spaces using computational homology theory. Betti numbers and formal classification accuracies are calculated for each feature space subset to establish a correlation between the topology of the class distribution and the corresponding classification accuracy.}

abstract = {Self-expanding stents made of Nitinol, a Nickel–Titanium shape memory alloy, are used in standard medical implants for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Despite the increasing success, clinical studies have reported stent failure after the deployment in the human body, thus undermining patient’s safety and life. This study aims to fill the gap of reliable assessment of the fatigue life of Nitinol stents. We propose a global computational design method for preclinical validation of Nitinol stents, which can be extended to patient-specific computations. The proposed methodology is composed of a mechanical finite element analysis and a fatigue analysis. The latter analysis is based on a novel multiaxial fatigue criterion of the Dang Van type, combining the shakedown response of the stent and the complexity of phase transformation taking place within the material. The method is implemented in the case of a carotid artery stent. The implant configuration as well as the applied cyclic loading are shown to affect material phase evolution as well as stent lifetime. The comparison with the results obtained by applying a strain-based constant-life diagram approach allows to critically discuss both fatigue criteria and to provide useful recommendations about their applicability.}

abstract = {The paper presents a review of existing literature in the field of coupling Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with Building Energy Simulations (BES) to better predict indoor environmental conditions and building energy implications. CFD is capable of providing a detailed analysis of airflow profile and temperature gradients in the space as well as better prediction of heat transfer involving convection and radiation. Whereas BES can provide dynamically changing boundary conditions to CFD to facilitate a precise transient analysis. Combining the two simulations provides a powerful framework to accurately predict building performance parameters. The review examines the variables exchanged between the two simulations and establishes that the Convective Heat Transfer Coefficient (CHTC) as the most important exchanged variable that can significantly improve the accuracy of energy simulations. Issues regarding the application of co-simulation mechanism are then discussed in terms of simulation discontinuities, along with strategies adopted by researchers to overcome the same. In the later sections, the review evaluates the applicability of co-simulation from the perspective of year-long building energy simulations and presents an overview of methods used in research to implement the same. Finally, the conclusions are discussed and the scope for future research in the field is presented. Practical implication: The review presents a critical analysis of essentially all major coupling strategies that can be used to perform a BES-CFD coupled analysis along with their strengths, limitations and possible application scenarios. Additionally, the problems associated with establishing the co-simulation are examined and various adopted solutions are presented along with methods implemented towards extending the practical applicability of such an analysis to encapsulate year-long simulations.}

abstract = {The aim of this study was to describe and compare perceptions of critical thinking, attitudes to and availability of research, research utilization and barriers to this among nursing students in Scandinavia and Indonesia. Data were collected at the beginning, middle and end of education from nursing students in Norway, Sweden (bachelor’s diploma) and Banda Aceh (bachelor’s diploma). Critical Thinking and Research Utilization Questionnaires were used along with the Barrier Scale. Descriptive analyses, comparisons between and within groups were performed. At the end of education, all samples exhibited positive attitudes to research and the main barrier was related to the setting. Scandinavian students reported higher critical thinking. Indonesian students perceived greater barriers on two Barrier subscales. No differences were found between the samples regarding research utilization. Significant changes over time varied among the samples except for the Norwegian sample. Indonesian students (diploma) exhibited most changes over time. Teachers must support nursing students to strengthen their critical thinking ability and develop professional competence.}

The authors then measure the efficiency of resource allocation under two different market conditions—commodities markets and auctions—and compare both market strategies in terms of price stability, market equilibrium, consumer efficiency, and producer efficiency. The results indicate that commodities markets are a better choice for controlling Grid resources than previously defined auction strategies.}

abstract = {Many countries and regions have reached a consensus to promote science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education in the past decade. A body of studies have demonstrated that the design and organization of interdisciplinary teaching activities are important for the effective implementation of STEM education. So far, however, little attention has been paid to the taxonomy of teaching models in STEM education. This paper aims to propose a taxonomy based on the dimensions of learning outcomes (i.e., product-oriented and knowledge-oriented) and teaching process (i.e., forward teaching model and reverse teaching model) in STEM education. Through the intersection of the above two dimensions, four teaching models in STEM education have emerged, including project-based learning (PBL), reverse engineering (RE), scientific inquiry (SI), and troubleshooting/debugging (T/D). In addition, four cases are introduced to explain how these four teaching models operate in STEM education. The implications of this work for future research are also discussed. It is promising that the study will be valuable to enrich the current research, and shed light on the theory and practice of STEM education.}
