abstract = {Coastlines are changing, wildfires are raging, cities are getting hotter, and spatial designers are charged with the task of designing to mitigate these unknowns. This research examines computational digital workflows to understand and alleviate the impacts of climate change on urban landscapes. The methodology includes two separate simulation and visualization workflows. The first workflow uses an animated particle fluid simulator in combination with geographic information systems data, Photoshop software, and three-dimensional modeling and animation software to simulate erosion and sedimentation patterns, coastal inundation, and sea level rise. The second workflow integrates building information modeling data, computational fluid dynamics simulators, and parameters from EnergyPlus and Landsat to produce typologies and strategies for mitigating urban heat island effects. The effectiveness of these workflows is demonstrated by inserting design prototypes into modeled environments to visualize their success or failure. The result of these efforts is a suite of workflows which have the potential to vastly improve the efficacy with which architects and landscape architects use existing data to address the urgency of climate change.}

abstract = {Background: Redox active metal cations, such as Cu2 +, have been related to induce amyloid plaques formation and oxidative stress, which are two of the key events in the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and others metal promoted neurodegenerative diseases. In these oxidative events, standard reduction potential (SRP) is an important property especially relevant in the reactive oxygen species formation. Objective: The SRP is not usually considered for the selection of drug candidates in anti-AD treatments. In this work, we present a computational protocol for the selection of multifunctional ligands with suitable metal chelating, pharmacokinetics, and redox properties. Methods: The filtering process is based on quantum chemical calculations and the use of in silico tools. Calculations of SRP were performed by using the M06-2X density functional and the isodesmic approach. Then, a virtual screening technique (VS) was used for similar structure search. Results: Protocol application allowed the assessment of chelating, drug likeness, and redox properties of copper ligands. Those molecules showing the best features were selected as molecular scaffolds for a VS procedure in order to obtain related compounds. After applying this process, we present a list of candidates with suitable properties to prevent the redox reactions mediated by copper(II) ion. Conclusion: The protocol incorporates SRP in the filtering stage and can be effectively used to obtain a set of potential drug candidates for AD treatments.}

abstract = {Three-way junctions in folded RNAs have been investigated both experimentally and computationally. The interest in their analysis stems from the fact that they have significantly been found to possess a functional role. In recent work, three-way junctions have been categorized into families depending on the relative lengths of the segments linking the three helices. Here, based on ideas originating from computational geometry, an algorithm is proposed for detecting three-way junctions in data sets of genes that are related to a metabolic pathway of interest. In its current implementation, the algorithm relies on a moving window that performs energy minimization folding predictions, and is demonstrated on a set of genes that are involved in purine metabolism in plants. The pattern matching algorithm can be extended to other organisms and other metabolic cycles of interest in which three-way junctions have been or will be discovered to play an important role. In the test case presented here with, the computational prediction of a three-way junction in Arabidopsis that was speculated to have an interesting functional role is verified experimentally.}

abstract = {Representing causal social science knowledge in models is difficult: much of the best knowledge is qualitative and ambiguously conditional, unlike the knowledge in “physics models.” This paper describes a stream of RAND research that began with qualitative models providing a structured depiction of casual factors creating effects. That has subsequently been extended to an unusual kind of uncertainty sensitive computational modeling that enables exploratory reasoning and analysis. We illustrate the approach with applications to counterterrorism, detection of terrorists, and nuclear crises. We believe that the approach will complement other approaches that can reflect social science phenomena [see other papers in this special issue of JDMS] and that the approach has broad potential within and beyond the national security domain. We also believe that it has the potential to inform empirical work—encouraging a transition from the step-by-step empirical testing of simple discrete hypotheses to the testing and refinement of more comprehensive causal models.}

abstract = {Motivated by the change of effective electrical properties grain or phase boundaries, a computational multiscale framework for continua with interfaces at the microscale is proposed. Cohesive-type interfaces are considered at the microscale, such that displacement and electrical potential jumps are accounted for. The governing equations for materials with interfaces under mechanical and electrical loads are provided. Based on these, a computational multiscale formulation is proposed. The coupling between the electrical and mechanical subproblem is established by the constitutive equations at the material interface. In order to investigate deformation-induced property changes at the microscale, the evolution of interface damage is elaborated. The proposed multiscale framework is further examined through various representative boundary value problems so as to identify its key properties.}

abstract = {Facebook remains the most important platform where social media editors package and try to ‘sell’ media outlets’ online news articles to audiences. In one of the first studies of its kind, we assess how this practice was effectuated during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We use computational analysis to determine the polarity, subjectivity and use of some linguistics features in the status messages of 140,359 Facebook posts of 17 mainstream and alternative news titles from Flanders (Belgium) between March 2020 and 2021. Among other things, we find that status messages score considerably higher than headlines in terms of polarity and subjectivity, and that they, along with the use of question and interrogation marks, peaked in the first months of the pandemic. We contextualise our findings within existing scholarship and wider trends in increasingly digitised and globalised media societies.}

abstract = {In a rapidly changing public health crisis such as COVID-19, researchers need innovative approaches that can effectively link qualitative approaches and computational methods. In this article, computational and qualitative methods are used to analyze survey data collected in March 2020 (n = 2,270) to explore the content of persuasive messages and their relationship with self-reported health behavior—that is, social distancing. Results suggest that persuasive messages, based on participants’ perspectives, vary by gender and race and are associated with self-reported health behavior. This article illustrates how qualitative analysis and structural topic modeling can be used in synergy in a public health study to understand the public’s perception and behavior related to science issues. Implications for health communication and future research are discussed.}

abstract = {The use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques enables performance predictions of bearing designs to be made when the usual operating assumptions of the Reynolds equation Jail to hold. This paper addresses the application of a full three-dimensional thermohydrodynamic CFD approach to journal bearings. The journal/shaft may extend beyond the bearing length and the rotation effect is accounted for in the thermal transport process. A circumferentially uniform shaft surface temperature is not assumed. Cavitation modelling is based on averaged lubricant/vapour properties and does not set pressures directly, allowing sub-ambient pressures to be predicted. Lubricant inlet grooves are incorporated with conservation of mass and the possibility of backflow. The modelling is validated against published experimental work on fully circumferential, single inlet and two-inlet circular bore bearings. The predicted and experimental results are in general agreement, although the predicted cyclic variation of journal surface temperature is less than the experimental value. However, an assumption in the predictions was of a non-orbiting journal. The techniques developed may, in principle, be extended to the orbiting journal case providing a dynamic cavitation model can be formulated.}
