abstract = {This article presents an experimental and computational study of the efficiency of an unshrouded transonic turbine. This research formed part of the EU Turbine Aero-Thermal External Flows II programme. The experiments were performed in the Oxford Turbine Research Facility (previously the Turbine Test Facility at QinetiQ, Farnborough). This facility is an engine scale, short duration, rotating transonic facility, in which M, Re, , and are matched to engine conditions. For these experiments, the MT1 turbine stage was installed. Historically, turbine efficiency measurements are conducted in steady state adiabatic facilities. However, short-duration facilities allow simultaneous aerodynamic and heat transfer measurements with a significant reduction in cost. An efficiency measurement system was developed for this investigation, and this is briefly described. The system allows efficiency to be evaluated to bias and precision errors of approximately ±1.45 per cent and ±0.16 per cent, respectively, to 95 per cent confidence. The results of accurate area surveys of the turbine inlet and exit flows are presented and discussed. At the turbine exit, data were taken at two traverse planes, approximately 0.5 and 4.5 rotor axial chords downstream of the rotor. The turbine efficiency was experimentally evaluated based on the data at both planes, using a number of mixing models, which are discussed and compared. The experimental result of turbine efficiency is also compared to that estimated from a mean-line prediction. Full-stage steady and unsteady computational fluid dynamics of the experiment using the Rolls-Royce HYDRA code was conducted and is also presented. The predicted and measured rotor exit flow-fields are compared at both downstream traverse planes.}

abstract = {Introduction: The emergence of new omics approaches, such as genomic algorithms to identify tumor mutations and molecular modeling tools to predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins, has facilitated the understanding of the dynamic mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of low-grade gliomas including oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas. Methods: In this study, we targeted known mutations involved in low-grade gliomas, starting with the sequencing of genomic regions encompassing exon 4 of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) and the four exons (5-6 and 7-8) of TP53 from 32 samples, followed by computational analysis to study the impact of these mutations on the structure and function of 3 proteins IDH1, IDH2, and p53. Results: We obtain a mutation that has an effect on the catalytic site of the protein IDH1 as R132H and on the catalytic site of the protein IDH2 as R172M. Other mutations at p53 have been identified as K305N, which is a pathogenic mutation; R175 H, which is a benign mutation; and R158G, which disrupts the structural conformation of the tumor suppressor protein. Conclusion: In low-grade gliomas, mutations in IDH1, IDH2, and TP53 may be the key to tumor progression because they have an effect on the function of the protein such as mutations R132H in IDH1 and R172M in IDH2, which change the function of the enzyme alpha-ketoglutarate, or R158G in TP53, which affects the structure of the generated protein, thus their importance in understanding gliomagenesis and for more accurate diagnosis complementary to the anatomical pathology tests.}

abstract = {The capacity to explain important elements of social life is central both to the development of sociological theory and to teaching sociology. This research seeks to expand our understanding of sociological explanation through a computational approach. Explanations commonly encountered in introductory sociology texts are used to develop a typology of explanatory forms. A computational strategy that represents sociological knowledge using a combination of frames, semantic networks, and procedural rules is described. It is then demonstrated that this approach can generate the full range of these explanations for all logical combinations of conditions and for the full scope of sociological knowledge. This approach is also shown to be capable of identifying appropriate explanations, assessing the quality of explanations, and generating new insights.}

abstract = {Abstract Performance of centrifugal fans with unshrouded impellers strongly depends upon complex configuration of the asymmetrical flowfield in the axial direction, which is highly unsteady. The flowfield, in turn, is considerably affected by the design parameters of both scroll and impeller geometry, for which tip clearance is of particular interest. This article presents a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of the flowfield in three different unshrouded centrifugal fan impellers with varying tip clearances. A commercial CFD code, namely, Fluent V6.2.16 with a k-ɛ two-equation turbulence model was utilized in order to study the effects of tip clearance on the overall performance of each fan with the tip clearances ranging from 5 to 30 mm. The numerical results were compared with the experimental data reported previously in the literature by the present author and his colleagues, and excellent agreements were observed for each fan.}

abstract = {Abstract The term ‘whiplash’ was initially used to describe injuries to the neck caused by the head being forced backwards during a rear-end collision in cars without head restraints. The addition of head restraints in the 1970s was expected to solve this problem by preventing excessive extension of the neck but experience suggests the problem still exists. This paper reviews available experimental studies of whiplash and uses the data to construct a finite element model which is capable of dynamically simulating whiplash collisions and predicting the forces in all the relevant neck ligaments. For the first time, it is shown that trauma occurs long before the head hits the head restraint as a result of displacement between the head and the torso caused by the head’s inertia leading to markedly different acceleration histories. It is concluded that experimental and computational studies must be used together to produce progress in biomechanical studies.}

Thirty-four children (ages 4.5–6.5 years) participated in computer programming activities with a developmentally appropriate tool, CHERP, specifically designed to program a robot’s behaviors. The children learned to build and program robots over three sessions, of 1.5 hours duration each, in a laboratory setting. The participants’ sequencing skills were assessed before and after the intervention using a picture-story sequencing task. Pre- and post-test scores were compared using a paired sample t-test. A significant increase in post-test scores compared to pre-test scores was found.}

abstract = {Bioreactor system has been used in bone tissue engineering in order to simulate dynamic nature of bone tissue environments. Perfusion bioreactors have been reported as the most efficient types of shear-loading bioreactor. Also, combination of forces, such as rotation plus perfusion, has been reported to enhance cell growth and osteogenic differentiation. Mathematical modeling using sophisticated infrastructure processes could be helpful and streamline the development of functional grafts by estimating and defining an effective range of bioreactor settings for better augmentation of tissue engineering. This study is aimed to conduct computational modeling for newly designed bioreactors in order to alleviate the time and material consuming for evaluating bioreactor parameters and effect of fluid flow hydrodynamics (various amounts of shear stress) on osteogenesis. Also, biological assessments were performed in order to validate similar parameters under implementing the perfusion or rotating and perfusion fluid motions in bioreactors’ prototype. Finite element method was used to investigate the effect of hydrodynamic of fluid flow inside the bioreactors. The equations used in the simulation to calculate the velocity values and consequently the shear stress values include Navier–Stokes and Brinkman equations. It has been shown that rotational fluid motion in rotating and perfusion bioreactor produces more velocity and shear stress compared with perfusion bioreactor. Moreover, implementing the perfusion together with rotational force in rotating and perfusion bioreactors has been shown to have more cell proliferation and higher activity of alkaline phosphatase enzyme as well as formation of extra cellular matrix sheet, as an indicator of bone-like tissue formation.}

abstract = {A computational approach to visual perception is outlined. The investigation centres on two problems. One concerns the shape, and the other the edges, of dot figures. In determining edges it is not possible to delimit arbitrarily the region on which each point computes. So in this context a global computation is defined. This leads to a novel way of investigating clustering. When the edges of a figure have been sequenced to yield the boundary it is then possible to determine its shape. The study of shape has been confined to convex figures. In these an attempt is made to extract global units which correspond to corner-like regions. Finally, it is suggested that a theory which evolves in the manner described has a more unitary aspect than other approaches.}

abstract = {During the sport of wave surfing, the fins on a surfboard play a major role in the overall performance of the surfer. This article presents the optimisation of a surfboard fin shape, using coupled genetic algorithms with the FLUENT® solver, aiming at the maximisation of the lift per drag ratio. The design-variable vector includes six components namely the chord length, the depth and the sweep angle of the fin as well as the maximum camber, the maximum camber position and the thickness of the hydrofoil (the four-digit NACA parametrization). The Latin hypercube sampling technique is utilised to explore the design space, resulting in 42 different fin designs. Fin and control volume models are created (using CATIA® V5) and meshed (unstructured using ANSYS® Workbench). Steady-state computations were performed using the FLUENT SST k−ω (shear stress transport k−ω) turbulence model at the velocity of 10 m/s and 10° angle of attack. Using the obtained lift and drag values, a response surface based model was constructed with the aim to maximise the lift-to-drag ratio. The optimisation problem was solved using the genetic algorithm provided by the MATLAB® optimisation toolbox and the response surface based model was iteratively improved. The resultant optimal fin design is compared with the experimental data for the fin demonstrating an increase in lift-to-drag ratio by approximately 62% for the given angle of attack of 10°.}

abstract = {Project-based learning (PBL) aims to foster students’ problem-solving ability and collaboration by engaging them in completing a project in teams. Researchers have indicated the importance of guiding students to make comparisons and reflection during the process of project-based learning. Therefore, the present research proposed a peer assessment-based PBL (PA-PBL) approach to boost students’ PBL performances. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a quasi-experiment was conducted for 3 weeks. A total of 110 secondary students were divided into an experimental group learning with the PA-PBL approach and a control group learning with the conventional PBL (C-PBL) approach. The students’ problem-solving tendency, learning achievement, and collaboration tendency were evaluated. The experimental results indicated that the PA-PBL approach improved the students’ learning achievement, especially for those students with higher problem-solving tendency. In terms of collaboration tendency, it was found that the PA-PBL approach benefited the lower problem-solving tendency students more than the C-PBL approach, while there was no difference between the higher problem-solving tendency students in the two groups. The experimental results also indicated that the PA-PBL approach could better enhance students’ problem-solving tendencies than the C-PBL approach.}
