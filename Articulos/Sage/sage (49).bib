abstract = {The simulation of cardiac electrophysiology is a mature field in computational physiology. Recent advances in medical imaging, high-performance computing and numerical methods mean that computational models of electrical propagation in human heart tissue are ripe for use in patient-specific simulation for diagnosis, for prognosis and for selection of treatment methods. However, in order to move in this direction, it is necessary to make efficient use of modern petascale computing resources. This paper focuses on an existing open source simulation framework (Chaste) and documents work done to improve the parallel scaling on a small range of electrophysiology benchmark problems. These benchmarks involve the numerical solution of the monodomain or bidomain equations via the finite-element method. At the beginning of this study the electrophysiology libraries within Chaste were already enabled to run in parallel and were able to solve for electrical propagation using the monodomain or bidomain equations, but parallel efficiency dropped rapidly when run on more than about 64 processors. Throughout the course of the study, improvements were made to problem definition input; geometric mesh partitioning; finite-element assembly of large, sparse linear systems; problem-specific matrix preconditioning; numerical solution of the linear system; and output of the approximate solution. The consequence of these improvements is that, at the end of the study, Chaste is able to solve a monodomain benchmark problem in close to real time. While some of the improvements made to the parallel Chaste code are specific to cardiac electrophysiology, many of the techniques documented in this paper are generic to the parallel finite-element method in other scientific application areas.}

Based upon 18 in-depth interviews with data journalism leaders within American newspapers, this study examines how newsrooms are restructuring to accommodate data news work. More specifically, the research identifies four “critical junctures” by which newspapers expand data journalism operations. The interviews establish that expanding a paper’s commitment to data journalism requires reorganizing the newsroom with new layers of structural complexity.}

The scope of the work is to describe the flow by means of computational fluid dynamics past the leading two cars of the train for yaw angles in the range 12.2–40.0°. Three track formations are utilized. The basic results are the set of independent aerodynamic coefficients for the lead and subsequent cars. The results are to some extent compared with experimental data for ICE 2 and also with data obtained for the Swedish high-speed train X2000. A numerical sensitivity study is undertaken to quantify differences in the above results dependent on the grid density and quality, turbulence model, numerical scheme, location of inlet and outlet boundaries, turbulence intensity and flow simulation software.}

abstract = {Objective Healthcare systems require transformation to meet societal challenges and projected health demands. Digital and computational tools and approaches are fundamental to this transformation, and hospitals have a key role to play in their development and implementation. This paper reports on a study with the objective of exploring the challenges encountered by hospital leaders and innovators as they implement a strategy to become a data-driven hospital organisation. In doing so, this paper provides guidance to future leaders and innovators seeking to build computational and digital capabilities in complex clinical settings. Methods Interviews were undertaken with 42 participants associated with a large public hospital organisation within England’s National Health Service. Using the concept of institutional readiness as an analytical framework, the paper explores participants’ perspectives on the organisation’s capacity to support the development of, and benefit from, digital and computational approaches. Results Participants’ accounts reveal a range of specific institutional readiness criteria relating to organisational vision, technical capability, organisational agility, and talent and skills that, when met, enhance the organisations’ capacity to support the development and implementation of digital and computational tools. Participant accounts also reveal challenges relating to these criteria, such as unrealistic expectations and the necessary prioritisation of clinical work in resource-constrained settings. Conclusions The paper identifies a general set of institutional readiness criteria that can guide future hospital leaders and innovators aiming to improve their organisation’s digital and computational capability. The paper also illustrates the challenges of pursuing digital and computational innovation in resource-constrained hospital environments.}

abstract = {A small-scale computational general equilibrium model is used to examine the efficiency costs of exempting commercial nonprofits from the corporate income tax when they compete directly with for-profit firms. Simulation results from differential-incidence experiments indicate significant welfare gains when the tax wedge is reduced at the margin between the for-profit and nonprofit firms and the change in government revenue is financed by lump-sum taxes. However, although welfare gains exist at the margin, average excess burden estimates suggest that some level of differential taxation is welfare-improving if nonprofits contribute to the production of a good with positive externalities. Results are compared with those from the literature on the differential taxation of corporate and noncorporate firms and are found generally consistent.}

abstract = {Past research has shown that multidimensional computational fluid dynamics modeling in combination with a genetic algorithm method is an effective approach for optimizing internal combustion engine design. However, optimization studies performed with a detailed computational fluid dynamics model are time intensive, which limits the practical application of this approach. This study addresses this issue by using a machine learning approach called Gaussian process regression in combination with computational fluid dynamics modeling to reduce the computational optimization time. An approach was proposed where the Gaussian process regression model could be used instead of the computational fluid dynamics model to predict the outputs of the genetic algorithm optimization. In this approach, for every nth generation of the genetic algorithm, the data from the previous n − 1 generations was used to train the Gaussian process regression model. The approach was tested on an engine optimization study with five input parameters. When the genetic algorithm was run solely with computational fluid dynamics, the optimization took 50 days to complete. In comparison with the computational fluid dynamics and Gaussian process regression approach, the computational time was reduced by 62%, and the optimization was completed in 19 days using the same amount of computational resources. Additional parametric studies were performed to investigate the impact of genetic algorithm + Gaussian process regression parameters. Results showed that either reducing the initial dataset size or relaxing the error criterion resulted in increased Gaussian process regression evaluations within the genetic algorithm. However, relaxing the error criterion was found to impact the model predictions negatively. The initial dataset size was found to have a negligible impact on the final optimum design. Finally, the potential of machine learning in further improving the optimization process was explored by using the Gaussian process regression model to check for the robustness of the designs to operating parameter variations during the optimization. The genetic algorithm was repeated with the modified procedure and it was shown that adding the stability check resulted in a different, more reliable and stable optimum solution.}

abstract = {The effects of hydrogen addition to internal combustion engines operated by natural gas/methane has been widely demonstrated experimentally in the literature. Already small hydrogen contents in the fuel show promising benefits with respect to increased engine efficiency, lower CO2 emissions, extended lean operating limits and a higher exhaust gas recirculation tolerance while maintaining the knock resistance of methane. In this article, the influence of hydrogen addition to methane on a spark ignited single cylinder engine is investigated. This article proposes a modelling approach to consider hydrogen addition within three-dimensional reactive computational fluid dynamics in order to establish a framework to gain further insights into the involved processes. Experiments have been performed on a single-cylinder spark-ignition engine situated at a test bed and cater as reference data for validating the proposed reactive computational fluid dynamics modelling approach based around the G-Equation combustion model. Within the course of the first part, crucial aspects relevant to the modelling of the mean engine cycle are highlighted. In this article, a simplified early combustion phase model which considers the transition towards a fully developed turbulent flame following ignition is introduced, along with a second submodel considering combined effects of the walls. The sensitivity of the combustion process towards the modelling approach is presented. The submodels were calibrated for a reference operating point, and a sweep in hydrogen content in the fuel as well as stoichiometric and lean operation has been considered. It is shown that the flame speed coefficient A appearing in the used turbulent flame speed closure, weighting the influence of the turbulent fluctuating speed , has to be adjusted for different hydrogen contents. The introduced submodels allowed for significant improvement of the in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate evolution throughout all considered operating conditions.}

abstract = {Learning to read is foundational for literacy development, yet many children in primary school fail to become efficient readers despite normal intelligence and schooling. This condition, referred to as developmental dyslexia, has been hypothesized to occur because of deficits in vision, attention, auditory and temporal processes, and phonology and language. Here, we used a developmentally plausible computational model of reading acquisition to investigate how the core deficits of dyslexia determined individual learning outcomes for 622 children (388 with dyslexia). We found that individual learning trajectories could be simulated on the basis of three component skills related to orthography, phonology, and vocabulary. In contrast, single-deficit models captured the means but not the distribution of reading scores, and a model with noise added to all representations could not even capture the means. These results show that heterogeneity and individual differences in dyslexia profiles can be simulated only with a personalized computational model that allows for multiple deficits.}

abstract = {Background Nasal adhesions (NAs) are a known complication of nasal airway surgery. Even minor NAs can lead to significant postoperative nasal airway obstruction (NAO). Division of such NAs often provides much greater relief than anticipated. Objective We examine the impact of NAs at various anatomical sites on nasal airflow and mucosal cooling using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and multiple test subjects. Methods CT scans of healthy adult subjects were used to construct three-dimensional nasal airway computational models. A single virtual 2.5 mm diameter NA was placed at one of five sites commonly seen following NAO surgery within each nasal cavity bilaterally, resulting in 10 NA models and 1 NA-free control for each subject. CFD analysis was performed on each NA model and compared with the subject’s NA-free control model. Results 4 subjects were recruited to create 44 computational models. The NAs caused the airflow streamlines to separate, leading to a statistically significant increase in mucosal temperature immediately downstream to the NAs (wake region). Changes in the mucosal temperature in the wake region of the NAs were most prominent in anteriorly located NAs with a mean increase of 1.62 °C for the anterior inferior turbinate NAs (P < .001) and 0.63 °C for the internal valve NAs (P < .001). Conclusion NAs result in marked disruption to airflow patterns and reduced mucosal cooling on critical surfaces, particularly in the wake region. Reduced wake region mucosal cooling may be a contributing factor to the exaggerated perception of nasal obstruction experienced by patients with NAs.}

abstract = {We present results obtained with new instrumental methods for the acoustic analysis of prosody to evaluate prosody production by children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Typical Development (TD). Two tasks elicit focal stress — one in a vocal imitation paradigm, the other in a picture-description paradigm; a third task also uses a vocal imitation paradigm, and requires repeating stress patterns of two-syllable nonsense words. The instrumental methods differentiated significantly between the ASD and TD groups in all but the focal stress imitation task. The methods also showed smaller differences in the two vocal imitation tasks than in the picture-description task, as was predicted. In fact, in the nonsense word stress repetition task, the instrumental methods showed better performance for the ASD group. The methods also revealed that the acoustic features that predict auditory-perceptual judgment are not the same as those that differentiate between groups. Specifically, a key difference between the groups appears to be a difference in the balance between the various prosodic cues, such as pitch, amplitude, and duration, and not necessarily a difference in the strength or clarity with which prosodic contrasts are expressed.}
