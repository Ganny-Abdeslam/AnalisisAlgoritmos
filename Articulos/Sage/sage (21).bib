abstract = {The prevalent availability of high-performance computing coupled with validated computerized simulation platforms as open-source packages have motivated progress in the development of realistic anthropomorphic computational models of the human anatomy. The main application of these advanced tools focused on imaging physics and computational internal/external radiation dosimetry research. This paper provides an updated review of state-of-the-art developments and recent advances in the design of sophisticated computational models of the human anatomy with a particular focus on their use in radiation dosimetry calculations. The consolidation of flexible and realistic computational models with biological data and accurate radiation transport modeling tools enables the capability to produce dosimetric data reflecting actual setup in clinical setting. These simulation methodologies and results are helpful resources for the medical physics and medical imaging communities and are expected to impact the fields of medical imaging and dosimetry calculations profoundly.}

abstract = {Computational Intelligence (CI) is a computer science discipline encompassing the theory, design, development and application of biologically and linguistically derived computational paradigms. Traditionally, the main elements of CI are Evolutionary Computation, Swarm Intelligence, Fuzzy Logic, and Neural Networks. CI aims at proposing new algorithms able to solve complex computational problems by taking inspiration from natural phenomena. In an intriguing turn of events, these nature-inspired methods have been widely adopted to investigate a plethora of problems related to nature itself. In this paper we present a variety of CI methods applied to three problems in life sciences, highlighting their effectiveness: we describe how protein folding can be faced by exploiting Genetic Programming, the inference of haplotypes can be tackled using Genetic Algorithms, and the estimation of biochemical kinetic parameters can be performed by means of Swarm Intelligence. We show that CI methods can generate very high quality solutions, providing a sound methodology to solve complex optimization problems in life sciences.}

abstract = {This article provides an overview of computer software and instructional strategies intended to engage young people in making computer games, to achieve a variety of educational goals. It briefly describes the most popular of such programs and compares their key features, including the kinds of games that can be created with the software, the types of communities and resources that are associated with each program, claims made for learning outcomes resulting from use of the software, and the results of empirical research (if any) on the application and outcomes of the software in formal or informal educational settings. A key finding is that existing software and educational applications stress the goal of teaching users about computer programming and place little or no emphasis on teaching concepts related to game design. It concludes by discussing the potential value of explicit attention to “design thinking” as goal of game making in education.}

abstract = {Block-based visual programming tools, such as Scratch, Alice, and MIT App Inventor, provide an intuitive and easy-to-use editing interface through which to promote programming learning for novice students of various ages. However, very little attention has been paid to investigating these tools’ overall effects on students’ academic achievement and the study features that may moderate the effects of block-based visual programming from a comprehensive perspective. Thus, the present study carried out a meta-analysis to systemically examine 29 empirical studies (extracting 34 effect sizes) using experimental or quasi-experiments involving the programming learning effects of employing block-based visual programming tools to date (until the end of 2019). The results showed a small to medium significant positive overall mean effect size (fixed-effect model g = 0.37; random-effects model g = 0.47) of the use of these block-based visual programming tools with respect to students’ academic achievement. Furthermore, the overall mean effect size was significantly affected by the educational stage, programming tool used, experimental treatment, and school location. Discussions and implications based on the findings are provided.}

abstract = {Idea generation in the design production process often occurs within brainstorming sessions. Linking ideas is the key mechanism in the process of producing design. Through linking ideas, a graph-like knowledge is achieved in representing the individual memories, with the nodes and arcs being the ideas and the links between ideas respectively. The design process is similar to doing a jigsaw. Using the jigsaw metaphor, a cognitive study is applied to the design tool DIM (Dynamic Idea Map) to explore computational jigsaw mechanisms. Thereafter, a computational framework called Design Jigsaw is developed to support students in assembling vast ideas effectively and reveals the construction of meaning in the graph-like knowledge structure of design thinking}

abstract = {This article explores the use of modding as a formal tool for learning history. The article examines data from a formal analysis of Europa Universalis IV (EUIV), a survey of 331 EUIV forum participants and a case study of 18 university participants. Significant quantitative survey data indicated that 45% (149/331) of participants had modified EUIV, and of the 125 participants who responded with comments about modding, a significant number (86/125 responses or 68.8%) explained how they had learnt about history, geography or other subjects through the modding process. Closer analysis of survey and case study responses and mods reveals the variety of ways participants learnt and critiqued history through the modding process. The article discusses the data and the pedagogical affordance of modding in a few steps. First, the article briefly explores the evidence that indicates modding is popular within the EUIV gaming community. In this instance, it examines whether given the popularity of gaming practice, modding might also be seen as a new casual form of engagement with games. Second, the article reviews the modding process in EUIV and examines how both playing and creating mods may be beneficial for learning history. Modding is examined in terms of its pedagogical importance and the unique educational opportunities it may offer that are not otherwise accessible through other forms of game-based learning. Finally, the article explores how and what the case study participants learnt when they were tasked with creating and implementing playable mods to demonstrate their understanding of history. Overall, the article considers the growing importance of mods, how learners can create and represent history using mods and how mods can provide a platform for learners to develop their own critique and analysis of official history.}

abstract = {Mapping a public discourse with the tools of computational text analysis comes with many contingencies in the areas of corpus curation, data processing and analysis, and visualisation. However, the complexity of algorithmic assemblies and the beauty of resulting images give the impression of ‘objectivity’. Instead of concealing uncertainties and artefacts in order to tell a coherent and all-encompassing story, retaining the variety of alternative assemblies may actually strengthen the method. By utilising the mobility of digital devices, we could create mutable mobiles that allow access to our laboratories and enable challenging rearrangements and interpretations.}

abstract = {Much debate has taken place on Joseph Needham’s question regarding ‘the failure of China and India to give rise to distinctively modern science while being ahead of Europe for fourteen previous centuries’. It is argued in this paper that while there is probably some truth in many of the sociocultural explanations that have been offered for the failure in India, they are in the final analysis not entirely convincing. The proposal in this paper is in two parts. The first is that the scientific revolution, which was part of a European miracle, was triggered in part by the advent of a variety of technologies from China and the new numeral system and other mathematical inventions from India - both via creative West Asian intermediaries. India had experienced a mathematical (more specifically algoristic or computational) revolution heralded by Ārya-bhata in the fifth century CE. The new computational power unleashed by this revolution combined with the classical Greek penchant for axiomatised modelmaking and a technology empowered experimental philosophy, in what appears to have been a very creative and uniquely European cultural fusion that led to the scientific (and later the industrial) revolution. The second part of the proposal is that there was an epistemological reason why the Indian mathematical revolution did not lead to a corresponding ‘distinctively modern’ scientific one. The Indic approach was basically not that of modelmakers but of ingenious algorisers, and showed a deep and studied distrust of axioms and physical models. This led to an attitude described here as ‘computational positivism’, which considers observation and computation as the only things that matter. In retrospect, that distrust appears not unjustified, especially in the light of twentieth century developments in quantum and classical mechanics and in logic; but it was historically expensive for India, as Europe achieved unreasonably and unexpectedly spectacular successes in science. To the Indians, it was Newton who was the extraordinary epistemological revolutionary, not Heisenberg or Gödel. In summary, Indian science could not move forward without the modelmaking and technology enabled experimental abilities that grew in the West, just as European modelmaking had earlier been unable to progress without the advent of powerful technologies and computational tools whose roots can be traced to China and India.}

abstract = {Algorithmic media have adopted and adapted divinatory practices and vernaculars of prediction, prophecy, probability, fortune-telling and forecasting – suggesting a possible link between artificial intelligence and pre-scientific modes of speculation. Statistical thinking and magical thinking, too, can be recognised as closely correlated epistemological systems for governing societies and ways of life. In fact, primitive astrological practices of looking up at the stars may represent one of the earliest statistical projects involving sophisticated calculations and data sets. Such pattern-making techniques could even be considered precursory to machine learning. As a point of departure for exploring these eclectic relationships between stars and data, magic and machines, I use a media archaeological methodology to question the historical roles of both astrological and computational divination in mediating methods of control, surveillance and knowledge production across transforming societal contexts. This methodology is especially relevant for examining historical narratives in the field of cultural studies as it makes apparent the hyper-connectedness between objects, cultural representation and sites of hegemonic contention. My findings reveal relationships between celestial pattern recognition and efforts to exert control over and manipulate the natural environment and its populations, the historical impact of meteorological and climatological practices for predicting and influencing future events with artificial intelligence, and links between statistics and algorithmic data biases. This article suggests a speculative genealogy of astrology and artificial intelligence, as well as a genealogy of the theological, scientific and machinic unconscious.}
