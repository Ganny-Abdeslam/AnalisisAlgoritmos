abstract = {Some of the most influential theories in organizational sciences explicitly describe a dynamic, multilevel process. Yet the inherent complexity of such theories makes them difficult to test. These theories often describe multiple subprocesses that interact reciprocally over time at different levels of analysis and over different time scales. Computational (i.e., mathematical) modeling is increasingly advocated as a method for developing and testing theories of this type. In organizational sciences, however, efforts that have been made to test models empirically are often indirect. We argue that the full potential of computational modeling as a tool for testing dynamic, multilevel theory is yet to be realized. In this article, we demonstrate an approach to testing dynamic, multilevel theory using computational modeling. The approach uses simulations to generate model predictions and Bayesian parameter estimation to fit models to empirical data and facilitate model comparisons. This approach enables a direct integration between theory, model, and data that we believe enables a more rigorous test of theory.}

abstract = {Abstract This paper demonstrates the suitability of using computational fluid dynamics software for solving steady state hydrodynamic lubrication problems pertaining to slider bearings, step bearings, journal bearings and squeeze-film dampers under conditions of constant unidirectional or rotating loading. The relevance of the inertia and viscous terms which are neglected in the derivation of the Reynolds equation are briefly investigated for the above bearing and damper configurations and it is shown that the neglected viscous terms have negligible effect whereas the inertia effect predictions agree reasonably well with those reported in the literature.}

abstract = {Anxiety is a pervasive emotional state that tends to arise in situations involving uncertainty due partly to social and contextual issues including competition, economic disparity, and social insecurity. Thus, distribution of aggregate emotions, such as in anxiety, may reveal an important picture of otherwise invisible social processes in which individuals interact with local and global opportunities, constraints, and potential threats. The aim of this study is to present a computational approach to the dynamic distribution of anxiety extracted from natural language expressions of users of Twitter, a popular global social media platform. We develop an unsupervised machine learning procedure based on a naive Bayes model to classify contents of anxiety, estimate the degree of anxiety, and construct a geographic map of spatiotemporal distribution of anxiety. To validate our mapping results, a multilevel statistical analysis was performed to examine how anxiety distribution is correlated with other district-level sociodemographic statistics such as rates of birth and early divorce. Implications for further research and extension are discussed.}

abstract = {Background. Educational games are nowadays used for facilitating the teaching and learning process of various subjects. History is one of the subjects that simulations and games are used for promoting active learning and supporting students in comprehending various history-related subjects. Aim. This article reports on a new educational game on Greek mythology, called MYTH TROUBLES, designed and developed from scratch with the aim of supporting primary school students in studying Greek mythology and raising their interest on the subject of history. Method. The article presents the educational rationale and design of MYTH TROUBLES in the context of an educational games design model proposed in the literature. Since the game was implemented with the platform of Scratch and it is available online both for students (or anyone interested in Greek Mythology) and game developers, some information for its implementation is also provided. The results of a pilot evaluation of MYTH TROUBLES with the help of 21 experienced school teachers are presented, along with proposals for improvement and extension of the game. Results. Teachers evaluated positively MYTH TROUBLES in terms of acceptability, usability, utility as an educational tool, as well as its interface and game play and expressed their willingness to use it in the classroom. Conclusions. MYTH TROUBLES is considered appropriate by teachers for supporting the teaching and learning of Greek mythology and assessing its educational value in class is the next step. Scratch is appropriate for implementing such educational games and sharing them with interested players and game developers.}

abstract = {People make subjective judgments about the healthiness of different foods every day, and these judgments in turn influence their food choices and health outcomes. Despite the importance of such judgments, there are few quantitative theories about their psychological underpinnings. This article introduces a novel computational approach that can approximate people‚Äôs knowledge representations for thousands of common foods. We used these representations to predict how both lay decision-makers (the general population) and experts judge the healthiness of individual foods. We also applied our method to predict the impact of behavioral interventions, such as the provision of front-of-pack nutrient and calorie information. Across multiple studies with data from 846 adults, our models achieved very high accuracy rates (r2 = .65‚Äì.77) and significantly outperformed competing models based on factual nutritional content. These results illustrate how new computational methods applied to established psychological theory can be used to better predict, understand, and influence health behavior.}

abstract = {Many creative activities take place in a group context, whether in short-term meetings, work teams, or by means of electronic interaction. The group creative process necessarily involves the exchange of ideas or information. Recent models of group creativity have focused on the cognitive underpinnings of this type of group creative process, primarily based on the group brainstorming literature. The authors describe an elaborated computational version of their cognitive model of group creativity and related computational models, and highlight some plausible neural bases for various involved processes. The major findings and theoretical perspectives in this literature are summarized and some potentially fruitful empirical and theoretical directions are highlighted. It is hoped that this comprehensive treatment can be a basis for integrating the present literature and providing useful predictions for further research on this topic.}

abstract = {This article presents a computational approach to examining immigrant incorporation through shifts in the social ‚Äúmainstream.‚Äù Analyzing a historical corpus of American etiquette books, texts from 1922‚Äì2017 describing social norms, we identify mainstream shifts related to long-standing groups which once were and may currently still be seen as immigrant outsiders in the United States: Catholic, Chinese, Irish, Italian, Jewish, Mexican, and Muslim groups. The analysis takes a computational grounded theory approach, combining qualitative readings and computational text analyses. Using word embeddings, we operationalize the chosen groups as focal group concepts. We extract sections of text that are salient to the focal group concepts to create group-specific text corpora. Two computational approaches make it possible to examine mainstream shifts in these corpora. First, we use sentiment analysis to observe the positive sentiment in each corpus and its change over time. Second, we observe changes in each corpus‚Äôs position on a semantic dimension represented by the poles of ‚Äústrange‚Äù and ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù The results indicate mainstream shifts through increases in positive sentiment and movement from strange to normal over time for most of the group-specific corpora. These research techniques can be adapted to other studies of social sentiment and symbolic inclusion.}

One way to overcome this restriction is to implement computational intelligence to support and extend the search and exploration process.

abstract = {For over a decade, the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) has been engaged in the applied research, development, and evaluation of computational toxicology methods used to support the safety evaluation of a diverse set of regulated products. The basis for evaluating computational toxicology methods is multi-factorial, including the potential for increased efficiency, reduction in the numbers of animals used, lower costs, and the need to explore emerging technologies that support the goals of the US FDA‚Äôs Critical Path Initiative (e.g. to make decision support information available early in the drug review process). The US FDA‚Äôs efforts have been facilitated by agency-approved data-sharing agreements between government and commercial software developers. This commentary review describes former and current scientific initiatives at the agency, in the area of computational toxicology methods. In particular, toxicology-based QSAR models, ToxML databases and knowledgebases will be addressed. Notably, many of the computational toxicology tools available are commercial products ‚Äî however, several are emerging as non-commercial products, which are freely-available to the public, and which will facilitate the understanding of how these programs work and avoid the ‚Äúblack box‚Äù paradigm. Through productive collaborations, the US FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, and the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, have worked together to evaluate, develop and apply these methods to chemical toxicity endpoints of regulatory interest.}
