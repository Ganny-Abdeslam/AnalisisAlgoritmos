abstract = {McShane et al.’s (2024) wide-ranging critique of null hypothesis significance testing provides a number of specific suggestions for improved practice in empirical research. This commentary amplifies several of these from the perspective of computational statistics—particularly nonparametrics, resampling/bootstrapping, and Bayesian methods—applied to common research problems. Throughout, the author emphasizes estimation (as opposed to testing) and uncertainty quantification through a comprehensive process of “curating” a variety of graphical and tabular evidence. Specifically, researchers should be encouraged to estimate the quantities that matter, with as few assumptions as possible, in multiple ways, then try to visualize it all, documenting their pathway from data to results for others to follow.}

abstract = {Studies of scientific and technological thinking can be organized via a taxonomy of methodological approaches that reveal areas for further study. Dunbar provides such a taxonomy, using biological methods like in vivo and in vitro as examples. In vitro corresponds to laboratory simulations of scientific thinking; In Vivo corresponds to field studies of actual scientists and inventors. Dunbar expands this taxonomy to incorporate historical studies of scientists and inventors, computer simulation and the possibility of neurological studies. These methods can and should be combined: Computational simulations are frequently based on historical case-studies, for example. In this article, a wide range of studies are classified according to this taxonomy, and their main points summarized. Consideration is also given to studies of scientific and technological thinking in collaborative dyads and teams. The article concludes with suggestions for future research.}

abstract = {Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) operation for coronary artery disease with different types of grafts has a large clinical application world wide. Immediately after this operation patients are usually relieved of their chest pain and have improved cardiac function. However, after a while, these bypass grafts may fail due to for example, neointimal hyperplasia or thrombosis. One of the causes for this bypass graft failure is assumed to be the blood flow with low wall shear stress. The aim of this research is to estimate the wall shear stress in a graft and thus to locate areas were wall shear stress is low. This was done with the help of a blood flow computer model. Postoperative biplane angiograms of the graft were recorded, and from these the three-dimensional geometry of the graft was reconstructed and imported into the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program FLUENT. The stationary diastolic flow through the grafts was calculated, and the wall shear stress distribution was estimated. This procedure was carried out for one native vessel and two different types of bypass grafts. One bypass graft was a saphenous vein and the other one was a varicose saphenous vein encased in a fine, flexible metal mesh. The mesh was attached to give the graft a defined diameter. The computational results show that each graft has distinct areas of low wall shear stress. The graft with the metal mesh has an area of low wall shear stress (< 1 Pa, stationary flow), which is four times smaller than the respective areas in the other graft and in the native vessel. This is thought to be caused by the smaller and more uniform diameter of the metal mesh-reinforced graft.}

abstract = {Politics is an area that is traditionally believed to be gender divided. According to intergroup communication theory, this gender-salient context might cause differences in political communications between genders. Moreover, the internet and social media, which creates a computer-mediated interactive context, might also impact the traditional gender discrepancies in political discourse. This study used Twitter trace-data and computational text analysis to examine such suppositions. By analyzing over one million tweets, we found that compared to men, women generally had a stronger sense of group awareness and cohesion and showed a desire to promote their tweets while avoiding addressing other users in political discussions. Women also focused on family- and home-related issues more than men did. These findings suggest that Twitter is not an ideal public sphere where differences and inequalities are eliminated, but it might be a counter-public sphere that promotes the voices and increases the publicity of marginalized groups.}

abstract = {Interfacial phenomena between the wafer and the polishing pad during chemical mechanical polishing are an area of great interest as they affect post-chemical mechanical polishing wafer topographies. Traditionally, the Reynolds equation has been used to predict the fluid pressure between the wafer and the polishing pad. However, with computational fluid dynamics it is possible to predict the fluid pressure and obtain insight into the fluid motion at the leading edge and trailing edge of the wafer. Additionally, computational fluid dynamics allows for the added ability to increase the resolution of the fluid physics to the asperity scale. In this study, a model is developed to predict phenomena related to mixed lubrication chemical mechanical polishing using computational fluid dynamics. Contact mechanics between the wafer and the pad are resolved through a Winkler elastic foundation formulation. The wafer is mounted on a ball joint which allows free rotation to occur. Friction between the wafer and the polishing pad causes the wafer to assume a position which produces a sub-ambient pressure distribution similar to that obtained from experiments. The effects of different table speeds on the interfacial fluid pressure, as predicted by the computational fluid dynamics are presented.}

abstract = {This paper introduces a computational aesthetics framework utilizing computer vision (CV) and artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict the aesthetic preferences of groups of people for architecture. It relies on part-to-whole theories from aesthetics and cognitive psychology. A survey of a group of people on preferences of images is held to record an average hedonic response (AHR). CV algorithms MSER and SAM recognize parts in images. Birkhoff’s aesthetic measure formula is adapted by employing the number of parts and their connections. These quantities are used as input layers of an ANN, and the AHR is the target output. The ANN evaluates images to output a predicted hedonic response (PHR), which is tested as a criterion in parametric design space navigation and in mapping the latent space of GANs. We conclude that such a framework is a heuristic method for better understanding the design and latent spaces and exploring designs.}

abstract = {Over the past decade, the ever-increasing energy demands of IT infrastructures have posed significant challenges for the research community in terms of reducing their total power consumption and minimizing their environmental impact. Optical communication networks are envisioned to be promising candidates to help preventing this problem affecting the Internet backbone, as well as for distributed applications such as computational grids. In this paper, we propose an adaptive and distributed scheme for the establishment of energy-efficient lightpaths in computational grids. The grid is deployed over an optical circuit-switched backbone network, defining an optical grid network. Each node of the backbone network maintains two different dynamic thresholds values and estimates the changes in network performance by evaluating the moving average of the total wavelength channel occupancy on all its input/output links. The nodes have the ability of reducing the energy consumption by entering into an Energy Saving Mode (ESM) on the basis of a comparison between their channel occupancy and the thresholds. Furthermore, we extend our framework by allowing the thresholds to be dynamically adapted depending on the network performance in terms of blocking probability. We show that the proposed method achieves considerable energy savings when compared to a normal energy-unaware operational mode and still allows to maintain an acceptable level of network performance in terms of blocking probability and end-to-end delay. Numerical results are obtained with a Java event-driven simulator of two different optical network topologies.}

abstract = {Conflict management is one of the most important issues in leveraging organizational competitiveness. However, traditional social scientists built theories or models in this area which were mostly expressed in words and diagrams are insufficient. Social science research based on computational modeling and simulation is beginning to augment traditional theory building. Simulation provides a method for people to try their actions out in a way that is cost effective, faster, appropriate, flexible, and ethical. In this paper, a computational simulation model for conflict management in team building is presented. The model is designed and used to explore the individual performances related to the combination of individuals who have a range of conflict handling styles, under various types of resources and policies. The model is developed based on agent-based modeling method. Each of the agents has one of the five conflict handling styles: accommodation, compromise, competition, contingency, and learning. There are three types of scenarios: normal, convex, and concave. There are two types of policies: no policy, and a reward and punishment policy. Results from running the model are also presented. The simulation has led us to derive two implications concerning conflict management. First, a concave type of resource promotes competition, while convex type of resource promotes compromise and collaboration. Second, the performance ranking of different styles can be influenced by introducing different policies. On the other hand, it is possible for us to promote certain style by introducing different policies.}
