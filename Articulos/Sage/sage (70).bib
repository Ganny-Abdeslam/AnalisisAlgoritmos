abstract = {Emerging artificial intelligence techniques such as genetic algorithms (GAs) allow a more realistic representation and solution of difficult and combinatorial problems such as the dynamic traffic queue management problem. Computational experience in solving such complex large-scale problems by use of micro-GAs is described. In addition to providing evidence of the ability of micro-GAs to successfully identify optimal traffic management schemes, some micro-GA-associated computational issues that warrant attention are highlighted. Choosing a proper population size is a critical decision, and internal variability must be accounted for to assess the goodness of the optimization results properly. A simple rule for deciding the best population size for micro-GAs is proposed. Micro-GAs may converge to low-quality solutions, particularly with very small population sizes; convergence of micro-GAs by itself is not a sufficient indication of good performance. The size of the search space for some real-world systems can pose some difficulties to micro-GAs. Choosing between micro-GAs and regular GAs is a problem-dependent decision.}

abstract = {Abstract This paper presents some results obtained during the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of internal flows inside a hydraulic component, using a scaling technique applied to numerical pre- and post-processing. The main aim of the work is to demonstrate the reduction of computational work needed for a complete analysis of component behaviour over a wide range of operating conditions. This result is achieved through the adoption of a methodology aimed at giving the highest level of generality to a non-dimensional solution, thereby overcoming the two major limitations encountered in the use of CFD in fluid power design: computer resources and time. In the case study, the technique was applied to a hydraulic distributor and computations were performed with a commercial computational fluid dynamics code. The key factor of this technique is the evaluation, for a given distributor opening, of the Reynolds number of the flow in the metering region. Provided that this number is high enough to ensure that the discharge coefficient has reached its asymptotic value, the characterization of the flow by a single non-dimensional numerical run can be shown. The theoretical contents of the analysis of the re-scaling technique, which focuses on the engineering information necessary in component design, are described in detail. The bases for its subsequent application to actual cases are then outlined. Finally, a fairly close correlation between numerical results and experimental data is presented.}

abstract = {People who interact with graphs to perform arithmetic tasks typically employ quantitative features. However, they may employ the spatial metaphor under two alternative conditions: if they have been trained to apply visual arithmetic methods to traditional line and bar graphs, or if they interact with specially constructed and special-purpose computational graphics. Two experiments explored a visual arithmetic method used to train subjects to determine a mean by locating the spatial midpoint of a set of indicators (bars in a bar graph or points in a line graph). In Experiment 1 visual arithmetic subjects determined the mean of five indicators as quickly as they did the mean of two indicators; control subjects performed slower with five indicators. Both groups took more time to add the values of five indicators than to add two indicators. In Experiment 2, unlike control subjects, visual arithmetic subjects’ response times in mean trials were unaffected by changes in the y-axis scale. However, both groups were affected by the y-axis scale on addition trials. Neither group was influenced by changes in the distance between indicators. The discussion addresses the transfer of visual arithmetic training to tasks that differ from the one used during training, uses for visual arithmetic and computational graphics, and the role of parallel processing and task restructuring in visual arithmetic.}

abstract = {Mixing and combustion of engine combustion network Spray A after end of injection are modeled using highly resolved multidimensional numerical simulations to explore the physics underlying recent experimental observations of combustion recession. Reacting spray simulations are performed using a traditional Lagrangian–Eulerian coupled formulation for two-phase mixture transport with a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes approach using the open-source computational fluid dynamics code OpenFOAM. Chemical kinetics models for n-dodecane by Cai et al. and Yao et al. are deployed to evaluate the impact of mechanism formulation and low-temperature chemistry on predictions of combustion recession behavior. Simulations with the Cai mechanism show that under standard Spray A conditions, the end-of-injection transient induces second-stage ignition in distinct regions near the nozzle that are initially spatially separated from the lifted diffusion flame, but then rapidly merge with flame. By contrast, the Yao mechanism fails to predict sufficient low-temperature chemistry in mixtures upstream of the diffusion flame during the end-of-injection transient and does not predict combustion recession for the same conditions. The effects of the shape and duration of the end-of-injection transient on the entrainment wave near the nozzle, the likelihood of combustion recession, and the spatiotemporal development of mixing and chemistry in near-nozzle mixtures are also investigated. With a more rapid ramp-down injection profile (ramp-down duration < 400 µs), a weaker combustion recession occurs earlier in time after the start of ramp-down. For extremely fast ramp-down (ramp-down duration = 0), the entrainment flux varies rapidly near the nozzle and over-leaning of the mixture completely suppresses combustion recession. For a slower ramp-down profile with respect to the standard Spray A condition, complete combustion recession back toward the nozzle is observed and combustion recession occurred later in time. Simulations qualitatively agreed with the past experimental and modeling observations of combustion recession with different end-of-injection transients.}

abstract = {Background Patellar tendinopathy (jumper’s knee) is characterized by localized tenderness of the patellar tendon at its origin on the inferior pole of the patella and a characteristic increase in signal intensity on magnetic resonance imaging at this location. However, it is unclear why the lesion typically occurs in this area of the patellar tendon as surface strain gauge studies of the patellar tendon through the range of motion have produced conflicting results. Hypothesis The predicted patellar tendon strains that occur as a result of the tendon loads and patella-patellar tendon angles (PPTAs) experienced during a jump landing will be significantly increased in the area of the patellar tendon associated with patellar tendinopathy. Study Design Descriptive laboratory study. Methods A 2-dimensional, computational, finite element model of the patella-patellar tendon complex was developed using anatomic measurements taken from lateral radiographs of a normal knee. The patella was modeled with plane strain rigid elements, and the patellar tendon was modeled with 8-node plane strain elements with neo-Hookean material properties. A tie constraint was used to join the patellar tendon and patella. Patella-patellar tendon angles corresponding to knee flexion angles between 0° and 60° and patellar tendon strains ranging from 5% to 15% were used as input variables into the computational model. To determine if the location of increased strain predicted by the computational model could produce isolated tendon fascicle damage in that same area, 5 human cadaveric patella-patellar tendon-tibia specimens were loaded under conditions predicted by the model to significantly increase localized tendon strain. Pre- and posttesting ultrasound images of the patella–patellar tendon specimens were obtained to document the location of any injured fascicles. Results Localized tendon strain at the classic location of the jumper’s knee lesion was found to increase in association with an increase in the magnitude of applied patellar tendon strain and a decrease in the PPTA. The principal stresses and strains predicted by the model for this localized area were tensile and not compressive in nature. Applying the tendon strain conditions and PPTA predicted by the model to significantly increase localized strain resulted in disruption of tendon fascicles in 3 of the 5 cadaveric specimens at the classic location of the patellar tendinopathy lesion. Conclusion The localized increase in patellar tendon strain that occurs in response to the application of tendon loads and decreased PPTA could induce microdamage at the classic location of the jumper’s knee lesion. Clinical Relevance The association of decreasing PPTA with increasing localized tendon strain would implicate the role of knee-joint angle as well as tendon force in the etiopathogenesis of jumper’s knee.}

abstract = {In the conveying process of a solid–liquid two-phase medium, the wear of the flow passage components is unavoidable. In this study, the solid–liquid two-phase flow in a centrifugal pump was numerically simulated by computational fluid dynamics–discrete element method coupling. For particle diameters up to 3 mm, the particle–particle and particle–wall interactions were considered in the simulation. Two-phase performance and wear experiments for different flow rates and particle concentrations were conducted. The wear experiment was carried out for 48 h at each mass concentration. In these experiments, a paint film method was used to display the wear position, and the wall thickness of the flow passage was measured using an ultrasonic thickness gauge. The results show that the instantaneous wear rate of the impeller, volute, and wear plate in the pump changed periodically with the impeller rotation. The volute wall wear was related to the particle movement. With the increase in the particle mass concentration, the wear rate increased. However, the rate of increase of the wear rate decreased because the particles moved to the wall in the volute to form a particle layer. Increasing the concentration did not linearly increase the effect of the particles on the wall.}

abstract = {The friction type tensioner is an energy absorbing component in belt drive system which has hysteretic torque and nonlinear damping. In this paper, a hysteretic model is used for describing the tensioner’s operating torque versus the imposed angle, and considered into the dynamic analysis of a belt drive system. The modeling process for calculating the vibration responses of a belt drive system is presented, and two iterative methods are proposed for estimating the tensioner’s nonlinear damping in a varying excitation frequency. One timing belt drive system is taken as a case study. The system’s vibration responses, such as the oscillation angle of tensioner arm, the transmission error between pulleys and the hub load on pulley are calculated and compared with the measured values, which validate the presented methods. The influence of iterative method on the computational efficiency and iterative accuracy are both discussed. At last a modified method is presented to improve iterative efficiency. The presented technique can improve the computational efficiency with a good computational accuracy.}

abstract = {Abstract A multi-body computational model of the human head and neck was previously shown to be in good agreement with experimental findings from actual human cervical spine specimens. The model segments were tested in three directions of loading showing main and coupled motions to be accurate and realistic. The model’s ability to predict the dynamic response of the head and neck, when subjected to acceleration pulses representing frontal, lateral, and rear-end impacts, is verified using experimental data derived from sled acceleration tests with human volunteers for 15 g frontal and 7 g lateral impacts and from isolated cervical spine specimen tests for rear-end impacts. Response corridors based on sled acceleration tests with human volunteers for frontal and lateral impacts are used to evaluate the model and investigate the effect of muscle activation on the head-neck motion. Firstly, the impacts are simulated with both passive and active muscle behaviour. Secondly, the local loads in the soft-tissue elements during the frontal impact are analysed. For rear-end impact simulation experiments using ligamentous isolated cervical spine specimens are used to evaluate the model performance before investigating the effects of muscle tensioning. Good agreement with human volunteer response corridors resulting from frontal and lateral impacts, and isolated cervical spine specimen sled test rear-end impact experiments is demonstrated for the model, highlighting the important role the muscles of the neck play in the head-neck response to acceleration impacts. The model is shown to be able to predict the loads and deformations of the cervical spine components making it suitable for injury analysis.}

The majority of these tasks must be computed in real-time to meet the high sampling rate modes of oper ations. Recently parallel processing has been used to speed up these computations. In this work, we propose a graph- based algorithm to map computational tasks onto multiple instruction-multiple data (MIMD) type of architectures. The algorithm automatically generates the task graph of a given task. Then an annealing procedure is used to allocate the gen erated subtasks to different processors, taking into account the network topology and the communication constraints. Moreover, the proposed technique is simple, flexible, and computationally viable. The efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated by a case study with good results.}

abstract = {How robust is a healthcare system? How does a patient navigate the system and what is the cost (e.g., number of medical services required or number of times the medical provider had to be changed to get access to the required medical services) incurred from the first symptoms to getting cured? How will it fare in the wake to a sudden epidemic or a disaster? How are all of these affected by administrative decisions such as allocating/diminishing resources in various areas or centralising services? These are the questions motivating our study on a formal prototype model for a healthcare system. We propose that a healthcare system can be understood as a distributed system with independent nodes (healthcare providers) computing according to their own resources and constraints, with tasks (patient needs) being allocated between the nodes. The questions about the healthcare system become in this context questions about resource availability and distribution between the nodes. We construct in this paper an Event-B model capturing the basic functionality of a simplified healthcare system: patients with different types of medical needs being allocated to suitable medical providers, and navigating between different providers for their turn for multi-step treatments.}
