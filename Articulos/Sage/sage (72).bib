abstract = {Abstract This study was carried out to assess the ability of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code to predict the scavenging flow in the transfer duct of a two-stroke cycle engine. A two-stroke cycle engine was modified to allow laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) measurements to be made in one transfer duct. It was operated under motoring conditions at 500r/min with a delivery ratio of 0.7. Predictions were obtained from a dynamic CFD simulation of the flow within the cylinder, transfer duct and a portion of the exhaust duct. Boundary conditions for the CFD model were obtained from experimentally measured pressure-time histories in the crankcase and exhaust. A comparison of measured and predicted transfer duct axial velocities at various locations within the duct showed that the CFD model could replicate the general trend of the flow but not the details. From the LDV measurements and CFD predictions, velocity oscillations were observed between the end of crankcase blowdown and transfer port closing. A one-dimensional general engine simulation package was used to investigate the gas dynamic activity in the transfer duct. It was found that the observed oscillations were due to pressure wave reflections in the transfer duct. The general trend of the axial velocity profile in the transfer duct was well replicated by the one-dimensional simulation as were the exhaust and crankcase pressures.}

abstract = {Computational brain models use machine learning, algorithms and statistical models to harness big data for delivering disease-specific diagnosis or prognosis for individuals. While intended to support clinical decision-making, their translation into clinical practice remains challenging despite efforts to improve implementation through training clinicians and clinical staff in their use and benefits. Drawing on the specific case of neurology, we argue that existing implementation efforts are insufficient for the responsible translation of computational models. Our research based on a collective seven-year engagement with the Human Brain Project, participant observation at workshops and conferences, and expert interviews, suggests that relationships of trust between clinicians and researchers (modellers, data scientists) are essential to the meaningful translation of computational models. In particular, efforts to increase model transparency, strengthen upstream collaboration, and integrate clinicians’ perspectives and tacit knowledge have the potential to reinforce trust building and increase translation of technologies that are beneficial to patients.}

abstract = {Abstract The present paper discusses the basic principles of hydraulic turbines, with special emphasis on the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) as a tool which is being increasingly applied to gain insight into the complex three-dimensional (3D) phenomena occurring in these types of fluid machinery. The basic fluid mechanics is briefly treated for the three main types of hydraulic turbine: Pelton, Francis and axial turbines. From the vast number of applications where CFD has proven to be an important help to the design engineer, two examples have been chosen for a detailed discussion. The first example gives a comparison of experimental data and 3D Euler and 3D Navier-Stokes results for the flow in a Francis runner. The second example highlights the state-of-the-art of predicting the performance of an entire Francis turbine by means of numerical simulation.}

abstract = {Water-lubricated bearings have attracted increasing attention in the field of high-speed machine tools for their low friction due to low viscosity. However, new problems, in particular, insufficient load capacity, are on the way. To the point, groove-textured journal bearing is adopted in this study. Aiming at investigating the effects of groove texture on high speed, water-lubricated, hydrodynamic journal bearing precisely, and thoroughly, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic analyses considering cavitation and turbulence are undertaken to assess the tribological performances of the bearing. To reduce the amount of three-dimensional modeling and meshing work, mesh deformation is presented. The numerical results are compared with experiments to verify the validity of the present models and calculation procedures. Pressure distribution, load capacity, and friction of groove-textured water-lubricated journal bearing are analyzed with respect to operating conditions and geometric parameters. Comparisons between groove-textured water-lubricated journal bearing and smooth bearing are carried out to find out the influence of groove texture. It is found that the groove texture can achieve a remarkable improvement of load capacity at a smaller eccentricity ratio and higher rotary speed. The load capacity is affected by the combined effects of groove depth, width, and length. However, generally, the friction force of water-lubricated journal bearing is slightly influenced by groove texture. Results can provide theoretical guidance for the optimal design of groove-textured water-lubricated journal bearing under different operating parameters.}

abstract = {This paper presents a mixed-fidelity model to investigate the effect of complex inlet distortion on aero gas turbine engines. The approach is developed by integrating a three-dimensional body force model of multistage compressors and a classical two-dimensional parallel engine model. The internal flow field of a high bypass ratio turbofan engine under different forms of total pressure distortion is simulated by the model. The simulations are discussed in depth to reveal the features of the distorted flow field in the compression components under the whole engine environment. The relationship between the overall performance of the engine and the intensity of inlet total pressure distortion is investigated quantitatively. It is evident that the mixed-fidelity model has the capability to quantitatively evaluate the effect of complex inlet distortion on the performance and the internal flow field of engines with low computational costs.}

The application is for internal combustion (IC) engine cooling galleries and experimental validation work has been undertaken. Three different boiling heat transfer models are described, one based on the principle of superposition (Chen) and two based on the partial boiling method (Thom and Cipolla). Overall, the Thom partial boiling approach was found to be the most representative of the three considered. However, numerous issues were found to be evident whatever approach was adopted and these are discussed in the paper. The partial boiling model was found to be the most simple to incorporate in the CFD model.}

Emphasis is laid on the interaction between the mechanical aspects of tribology and the characteristics of the cutting process. Firstly, the fundamentals of the mechanics and physics of cutting processes are outlined. This is extended to friction and lubrication at the tool-workpiece interface and tool wear. On the basis of this quantitative knowledge, the interaction of tribology with a cutting process is demonstrated by means of computer simulation including machinability of free-cutting steels, cutting fluid action and prediction of tool wear. Finally, concluding remarks are devoted to the interaction of tribology with wider aspects of cutting towards the goal of ‘better machining‘.}

abstract = {In the present paper, two configurations of structured reactors (with and without) chimney tray placed below the packed bed have been investigated to study their effect on maldistribution factor and pressure drop characteristics. A simulation result based on a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics was involved using ANSYS Fluent. First, maldistribution factors without chimney tray were calculated and compared to the results taken from the literature. The results were found to be in good agreement with the experimental data of Yuan et al. Second, the reactor with a chimney tray was modeled in Fluent, and steady-state simulations were performed. The uniformity due to the turbulence of the fluid was carried out using different turbulence models, and the velocity profiles along the axial direction inside the reactor were obtained. As a result, the comparison shows that the presence of a chimney tray yields lower maldistribution factor enhancement by 23% compared to the conventional structured reactor under the same operating condition. The effect of the plate orientation is also determined, and it is found that the maximum pressure drop is achieved through the rows with an orientation angle of α = 45° up to 2.3% higher than of α = 0° and α = 90°.}

abstract = {Relatively little attention has been paid to the venous system and valves from a cardiovascular engineering perspective up to now. Given the involvement of venous valve haemodynamics in the development of deep vein thrombosis this is an area that needs more detailed investigation and close collaboration between clinicians and cardiovascular engineers. The purpose of this review article is to provide an indication of the physiological conditions that need to be included in any computational model of the venous system, based on recommendations from clinicians, and to summarize published computational models of the venous system by trying to explore their limitations and application range. A MEDLINE search was carried out on the relevant literature from 1940 until today. Several models have been developed with a specific purpose in mind to coincide with the aim of each individual study. The model complexity and laws used in each model vary significantly. There are more simplistic computational models based on electric circuit analogies, termed as lumped parameter models, which can be used to provide boundary conditions to one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) domain models, followed by 1D continuous models based on analytical equations, which allow the description of pressure wave and can be non-linear in nature. Finally, there are the more advanced 3D models, which are based on the principles of haemodynamics, and consider the compliance of the venous system and the effect that venous valves have on the cardiovascular system. In conclusion, it appears that computer modelling of the venous system can contribute greatly to our understanding of venous physiology and allow us to evaluate the haemodynamic interactions that occur in the venous system under different physiological conditions.}
