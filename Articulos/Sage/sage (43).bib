abstract = {With the release of the Next Generation Science Standards and the adoption of the standards by many states, teachers are encouraged to use the engineering design process (EDP) as an instructional approach to teaching science. However, teachers have limited time to teach science and will often neglect science in favor of mathematics and literacy instruction. To make this feasible for elementary classrooms, teachers should be encouraged to implement integrated units of study utilizing EDP to cohesively bind content areas and to increase active learning, critical thinking, and problem solving among all learners. An additional benefit of using EDP as an instructional strategy is the focus on problem solving and the avoidance of one size fits all learning. Students actively engage in learning content (science, mathematics, literacy, social studies) as they collaboratively work together to solve societal and environmental problems. Knowledge is built as students progress through the challenges and content is provided on a need to know basis, thereby differentiating instruction based on learner needs and challenging gifted learners. In this article, the author provides four sample engineering challenges that can be used to create an integrated unit of study using the EDP as an instructional strategy.}

abstract = {Discussions about the replicability of psychological studies have primarily focused on improving research methods and practices, with less attention paid to the role of well-specified theories in facilitating the production of reliable empirical results. The field is currently in need of clearly articulated steps to theory specification and development, particularly regarding frameworks that may generalize across different fields of psychology. Here we focus on two approaches to theory specification and development that are typically associated with distinct research traditions: computational modeling and construct validation. We outline the points of convergence and divergence between them to illuminate the anatomy of a scientific theory in psychology—what a well-specified theory should contain and how it should be interrogated and revised through iterative theory-development processes. We propose how these two approaches can be used in complementary ways to increase the quality of explanations and the precision of predictions offered by psychological theories.}

abstract = {Today’s world allows people to connect over larger distances and in shorter intervals than ever before, widely monitored by massive online data sources. Ongoing worldwide computerization has led to completely new opportunities for social scientists to conceive human interactions and relations in unknown precision and quantities. However, the large data sets require techniques that are more likely to be found in computer and natural sciences than in the established fields of social relations. In order to facilitate the participation of social scientists in an emerging interdisciplinary research branch of “computational social science,” we propose in this article the usage of the Python programming language. First, we carve out its capacity to handle “Big Data” in suitable formats. Second, we introduce programming libraries to analyze large networks and big text corpora, conduct simulations, and compare their performance to their counterparts in the R environment. Furthermore, we highlight practical tools implemented in Python for operational tasks like preparing presentations. Finally, we discuss how the process of writing code may help to exemplify theoretical concepts and could lead to empirical applications that gain a better understanding of the social processes initiated by the truly global connections of the Internet era.}

abstract = {People spend most of their time indoors; therefore, maintaining a good indoor air quality and meeting the requirements of comfort and energy efficiency are essential. One of the most widespread strategies to achieve this objective is improving ventilation efficiency; therefore, the main aim of this study was to show an optimization of the ventilation efficiency, in a specific room, considering 47 variations (case studies) in the furniture arrangement. For this purpose, a numerical analysis using computational fluid dynamics techniques, validated by the tracer gas decay technique, was used to assess the distribution of the age of air within the space. The concept of “age of air” was implemented in the computational fluid dynamics code through user-defined functions, using the steady-state method based on the resolution of a transport equation for an additional scalar. Variations up to 5.75% in the ventilation efficiency between the cases studied have been achieved. It is concluded that an improvement up to 1.65% can be obtained when the elements of the study are introduced in a way that facilitates the air movement towards the exhaust; therefore, improvement of the ventilation efficiency through specific furniture distributions is possible, although not significant, according to the outcomes.}

abstract = {Computational design of small molecule putative inhibitors of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is presented. Plk1, which regulates the cell cycle, is often over expressed in cancers. Down regulation of Plk1 has been shown to inhibit tumor progression. Most kinase inhibitors interact with the ATP binding site on Plk1, which is highly conserved. This makes the development of Plk1-specific inhibitors challenging, since different kinases have similar ATP sites. However, Plk1 also contains a unique region called the polo-box domain (PBD), which is absent from other kinases. In this study, the PBD site was used as a target for designed Plk1 putative inhibitors. Common structural features of several experimentally known Plk1 ligands were first identified. The findings were used to design small molecules that specifically bonded Plk1. Drug likeness and possible toxicities of the molecules were investigated. Molecules with no implied toxicities and optimal drug likeness values were used for docking studies. Several molecules were identified that made stable complexes only with Plk1 and LYN kinases, but not with other kinases. One molecule was found to bind exclusively the PBD site of Plk1. Possible utilization of the designed molecules in drugs against cancers with over expressed Plk1 is discussed.}

abstract = {Knowledge and skill in multiplication were investigated for late elementary-grade students with mathematics learning disabilities (MLD), typically achieving age-matched peers, low-achieving age-matched peers, and ability-matched peers by examining multiple measures of computational skill, working memory, and conceptual knowledge. Poor multiplication fact mastery and calculation fluency and general working memory discriminated children with MLD from typically achieving age-matched peers. Furthermore, children with MLD were slower in executing backup procedures than typically achieving age-matched peers. The performance of children with MLD on multiple measures of multiplication skill and knowledge was most similar to that of ability-matched younger children. MLD may be due to difficulties in computational skills and working memory. Implications for the diagnosis and remediation of MLD are discussed.}

abstract = {A numerical model based on computational fluid dynamics is developed to analyze fluid flow and thermal aspects in grinding. The model uses multiphase fluid flow with heat transfer based on the volume-of-fluid method, convection, conduction in solids and a multiple reference frame model of the porous grinding zone. Fluid velocity vectors, useful flow rate, grinding temperatures and energy partition are predicted using the model. In lieu of direct measurements of these quantities, the verification relies on the indirect assessment of surface integrity. The simulation results provide adequate agreement with the measured residual stress, depth of heat-affected zone and full width at half maximum profile with respect to the grinding temperatures.}

abstract = {Presentation of data is a major component to academic research. However, programming languages, computational tools, and methods for exploring and analyzing data can be time consuming and frustrating to learn and finding help with these stages of the broader research process can be daunting. In this work, we highlight the impacts that computational research support programs housed in library contexts can have for fulfilling gaps in student, staff, and faculty research needs. The archival history of one such organization, Software and Services for Data Science (SSDS) in the Stanford University Cecil H. Green Library, is used to outline challenges faced by social sciences and humanities researchers from the 1980s to the present day. To compliment this history, participation metrics from consulting services (1999–2021) and workshops (2000–2021) are presented along with updated workshop participant feedback forms (n = 99) and further illustrate the profound impacts that these services can have for helping researchers succeed. Consulting and workshop metrics indicate that SSDS has supported at least 27,031 researchers between 1999 and 2021 (average of more than 1175 per year). A t-test on the feedback form data indicates that participant knowledge in workshops statistically significantly increased more than one scale point from workshop start to completion. Results also indicate that despite our successes, many past challenges continue to present barriers regardless of exponential advances in computing, teaching, and learning—specifically around learning to access data and learning the software and tools to use it. We hope that our story helps other institutions understand how indispensable computational research support is within the library.}

abstract = {The current criterion for surgical intervention in abdominal aortic aneurysms, based upon a maximal aortic diameter, is considered conservative due to the high mortality rate in case of rupture. The research community is actively investigating the use of computational mechanics tools combined with patient-specific imaging to help identify more accurate criteria. Widespread uptake of a successful metric will however be limited by the need for computed tomography, which is at present the primary image extraction method on account of the location and complex shape of the aneurysms. The use of three-dimensional ultrasound as the scanning method is more attractive on account of increased availability, reduced cost and reduced risk to patients. The suitability of three-dimensional ultrasound is assessed for this purpose in the present work; computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed on geometries obtained from the same patient using both ultrasound and computed tomography. The influence of different smoothing algorithms is investigated in the geometry preparation stage and Taubin’s low-pass filter was found to best preserve geometry features. Laminar, Newtonian, steady-state simulation analysis identified haemodynamic characteristics to be qualitatively similar in terms of wall shear stress, velocity and vorticity. The study demonstrates the potential for three-dimensional ultrasound to be integrated into a more accessible patient-specific modelling tool able to identify the need for surgical intervention of abdominal aortic aneurysms.}

Theory machines are intended to capture computation on an arbitrary system, both physical and unphysical, including quantum computers, Blum-Shub-Smale machines, and infinite time Turing machines. We demonstrate that for finite problems, the computational power of any device characterisable by a finite first-order theory machine is equivalent to that of a Turing machine. Whereas for infinite problems, their computational power is equivalent to that of a type-2 machine. We then develop a concept of complexity for theory machines, and prove that the class of problems decidable by a finite first order theory machine with polynomial resources is equal to 𝒩𝒫 ∩ co-𝒩𝒫.}
