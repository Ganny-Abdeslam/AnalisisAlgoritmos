abstract = {This article considers the issue of opacity as a problem for socially consequential mechanisms of classification and ranking, such as spam filters, credit card fraud detection, search engines, news trends, market segmentation and advertising, insurance or loan qualification, and credit scoring. These mechanisms of classification all frequently rely on computational algorithms, and in many cases on machine learning algorithms to do this work. In this article, I draw a distinction between three forms of opacity: (1) opacity as intentional corporate or state secrecy, (2) opacity as technical illiteracy, and (3) an opacity that arises from the characteristics of machine learning algorithms and the scale required to apply them usefully. The analysis in this article gets inside the algorithms themselves. I cite existing literatures in computer science, known industry practices (as they are publicly presented), and do some testing and manipulation of code as a form of lightweight code audit. I argue that recognizing the distinct forms of opacity that may be coming into play in a given application is a key to determining which of a variety of technical and non-technical solutions could help to prevent harm.}

abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to examine the structure and development of algebraic thinking across multiple dimensions. An algebraic thinking test was administered to 803 students aged 10–13 years old. One hundred and one students of different performance outcomes in the algebraic thinking test participated in semi-structured clinical interviews in order to develop further insights into students’ strategies and difficulties. The results confirmed the multifaceted nature of algebraic thinking and showed that algebraic thinking consists of three aspects: reasoning about covariation, generalization of arithmetic properties and abilities directly related to algebraic syntax. Each one of these aspects is composed of specific algebraic thinking abilities, such as modelling relations using algebraic symbols. Four groups of students of different algebraic thinking profiles were identified: ‘pre-algebraic’, ‘protoalgebraic-procedural’, ‘relational-symbolic algebraic thinking’ and ‘structural-global algebraic thinking’. The results also supported the presence of a consistent trend in the difficulty level across the algebraic thinking abilities, which suggests a specific developmental trend from a more procedural perspective of algebraic thinking to a more structural one.}

abstract = {Mel Ember was co-Principal Investigator in the Mason-HRAF Joint Project on Eastern Africa, a multiyear project aimed at developing and analyzing advanced computational agent-based models of human societies across 10 countries and 12 ecosystems. A major unsolved challenge in this kind of social science research is to devise a systematic way to compare, contrast, and communicate different models of social dynamics along relevant dimensions and characteristics, given the inherent complexity of most computational agent-based models. This article proposes a viable systematic framework for comparing models and illustrates its application using some of the models that Mel helped inspire and develop as senior project participant.}

abstract = {The complex nature of the tire/road noise generation process makes it difficult to isolate and study each mechanism individually. This paper presents an experimental and numerical investigation of air-borne tire noise generation mechanisms for a realistic tire. Experimentally, a single slot is cut into the tire and the noise data are measured and studied. Air-borne noise is isolated by filling the slot with foam and comparing the resulting frequency spectra. Numerically, a previously developed computational fluid dynamics tire noise prediction model is employed to predict the air-borne noise for the same tire, under similar operating conditions. A direct comparison between the experimental and computational results is also presented in terms of pressure time traces and spectral characteristics. Comparisons indicate that the computational model is capable of predicting the noise generated by the air pockets in the tire. While providing a deeper understanding of the causes of air-borne noise, this paper also aims to demonstrate the use of a computational tool that can be used to obtain a reasonably accurate prediction of air-borne tire noise.}

abstract = {Recent neuroscientific evidence in human and non-human primates indicates that the regions that become active during motor execution and motor observation overlap extensively in the cerebral cortex. This suggests that to observe an action, these primates employ their motor and somatosensation areas in order to simulate it internally. In line with this finding, in the current paper, we examine relevant neuroscientific evidence in order to design a computational agent that can facilitate observational learning of reaching movements. For this reason, we develop a novel motor control system, inspired from contemporary theories of motor control, and demonstrate how it can be used during observation to facilitate learning, without the active involvement of the agent’s body. Our results show that novel motor skills can be acquired only by observation, by optimizing the peripheral components of the agent’s motion.}

abstract = {In this article we propose a computational model that describes how observed behavior can influence an observer’s own behavior, including the acquisition of new task descriptions. The sources of influence on our model’s behavior are: beliefs about the world’s possible states and actions causing transitions between them; baseline preferences for certain actions; a variable tendency to infer and share goals in observed behavior; and a variable tendency to act efficiently to reach rewarding states. Acting on these premises, our model is able to replicate key empirical studies of social learning in children and chimpanzees. We demonstrate how a simple artificial system can account for a variety of biological social transfer phenomena, such as goal-inference and over-imitation, by taking into account action constraints and incomplete knowledge about the world dynamics.}

abstract = {RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are at the core of post-transcriptional regulation and thus of gene expression control at the RNA level. One of the principal challenges in the field of gene expression regulation is to understand RBPs mechanism of action. As a result of recent evolution of experimental techniques, it is now possible to obtain the RNA regions recognized by RBPs on a transcriptome-wide scale. In fact, CLIP-seq protocols use the joint action of CLIP, crosslinking immunoprecipitation, and high-throughput sequencing to recover the transcriptome-wide set of interaction regions for a particular protein. Nevertheless, computational methods are necessary to process CLIP-seq experimental data and are a key to advancement in the understanding of gene regulatory mechanisms. Considering the importance of computational methods in this area, we present a review of the current status of computational approaches used and proposed for CLIP-seq data.}

abstract = {Abstract Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of ship airwakes are discussed in this article. CFD is used to simulate the airwakes of landing helicopter assault (LHA) and landing platform dock-17 (LPD-17) classes of ships. The focus is on capturing the massively separated flow from sharp edges of blunt bodies, while ignoring the viscous effects. A parallel, finite-volume flow solver is used with unstructured grids on full-scale ship models for the CFD calculations. Both steady-state and time-accurate results are presented for a wind speed of 15.43 m/s (30 knot) and for six different wind-over-deck angles. The article also reviews other computational and experimental ship airwake research.}
