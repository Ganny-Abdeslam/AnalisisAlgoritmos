abstract = {Predictive modeling of pre-chamber combustion engines relies primarily on the correct description of laminar and turbulent flame speeds. For engineering applications, the correlations of the flame speeds with physical variables involve empirical constants that are valid for a limited range of operating conditions. The current work aims at assessing the significance of laminar flame speed prediction in the simulation of ultra-lean pre-chamber engine combustion operated with methane. Gülder’s empirical correlation for laminar flame speed was chosen as a reference and was further modified for equivalence ratio, pressure and temperature ranges beyond what it was originally derived for, in order to confirm the original hypothesis; the pressure and temperature dependence were adopted as a power-law correlation. Based on the computational results using the skeletal reaction mechanism, the correlation was modified better represent the flame speeds at ultra-lean engine conditions, using GRI 3.0 as a reference. The modified correlation for methane was implemented in CONVERGE, a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver, and the results were validated against the experimental data. In all cases, the original formulation of Peters’s turbulent flame speed correlation was used and was found to have insignificant effect on the conditions under study, confirming the importance of the accurate determination of the laminar flame speed that dominates over any turbulence corrections for high Karlovitz number effects. The flame topology was also investigated to provide insights into the observed pressure behavior among the tested cases. Finally, the relevant turbulent combustion regimes encountered in the pre-chamber combustion engine conditions were examined in the Borghi-Peters diagram, further confirming the findings of the study.}

abstract = {The problem of publication bias has long been discussed in research fields such as medicine. There is a consensus that publication bias is a reality and that solutions should be found to reduce it. In methodological computational research, including cancer informatics, publication bias may also be at work. The publication of negative research findings is certainly also a relevant issue, but has attracted very little attention to date. The present paper aims at providing a new formal framework to describe the notion of publication bias in the context of methodological computational research, facilitate and stimulate discussions on this topic, and increase awareness in the scientific community. We report an exemplary pilot study that aims at gaining experiences with the collection and analysis of information on unpublished research efforts with respect to publication bias, and we outline the encountered problems. Based on these experiences, we try to formalize the notion of publication bias.}

abstract = {This study investigates pre-service computer science (CS) teachers’ perspectives on the factors affecting their programming abilities, concerns about their future professional lives, and pedagogical suggestions for effective programming teaching. The participants of the study were twenty-eight pre-service CS teachers studying at eighteen different universities in Türkiye. The data was gathered with a questionnaire consisting of open-ended questions. Results showed that inherent programming challenges, personal factors, and quality of undergraduate education affected pre-service CS teachers’ abilities in programming teaching. They were concerned about their professional lives relating to programming teaching, keeping up with technological innovations, pedagogical concerns, and teaching practice. They also suggested pedagogical approaches that could be used in programming teaching under two categories, namely basic programming teaching, and teaching principles and techniques. The study contributes to the development of programming teaching by shedding light on the current perspectives of pre-service CS teachers on programming education.}

abstract = {We investigate a new approach for characterizing class separability based on topological measures for use with identifying flaw severity in plates. Multi-mode Lamb waves are propagated across a flat-bottom hole of varying depth. Lamb wave tomography reconstructions are first generated to locate and size the flaw at each depth. As the flaw depth increases, scattering and mode conversion effects dominate the raw time-domain signals, obscuring information about flaw severity. Pattern classification provides an alternate means for processing the ultrasonic waveforms to identify flaw severity. High-dimensional feature spaces are generated from the Lamb wave signals using the dynamic wavelet fingerprinting technique. In order to achieve high classification accuracy, an optimal feature space is required. An intelligent feature selection routine is explored here that identifies favorable class distributions in multidimensional feature spaces using computational homology theory. Betti numbers and formal classification accuracies are calculated for each feature space subset to establish a correlation between the topology of the class distribution and the corresponding classification accuracy.}

abstract = {Any hydraulic reaction turbine is installed with a draft tube that impacts widely the entire turbine performance, on which its functions are as follows: drive the flux in appropriate manner after it releases its energy to the runner; recover the suction head by a suction effect; and improve the dynamic energy in the runner outlet. All these functions are strongly linked to the geometric definition of the draft tube. This article proposes a geometric parametrization and analysis of a Francis turbine draft tube. Based on the parametric definition, geometric changes in the draft tube are proposed and the turbine performance is modeled by computational fluid dynamics; the boundary conditions are set by measurements performed in a hydroelectric power plant. This modeling allows us to see the influence of the draft tube shape on the entire turbine performance. The numerical analysis is based on the steady-state solution of the turbine component flows for different guide vanes opening and multiple modified draft tubes. The computational fluid dynamics predictions are validated using hydroelectric plant measurements. The prediction of the turbine performance is successful and it is linked to the draft tube geometric features; therefore, it is possible to obtain a draft tube parameter value that results in a desired turbine performance.}

abstract = {Objective SARS-CoV-2 coinfection with Streptococcus pyogenes and S pneumoniae increases disease severity, thus deserving more in-depth understanding. Methods The potential of garlic extract against the bacteria has been theoretically examined and extended to synergic predictions on SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron variants. Results Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry characterized five main components in the extract: benzeneacetaldehyde (A1; 5.65%), diallyl disulfide (A2; 19.27%), 1-allyl-3-methyltrisulfane (A3; 21.30%), methyl salicylate (A4; 7.49%), and diallyl trisulfide (A5; 39.26%). Bioassay-based inhibition zones were 8 ± 2 mm, and MIC values 64 mg·mL−1 (S pneumoniae) and 128 mg·mL−1 (S pyogenes). Density functional theory suggested the organosulfur components as the most promising inhibitors with electrophilic sites at their sulfur atoms. Molecular docking simulation agreed with their potential against S pneumoniae/S pyogenes luxS proteins and Delta/Omicron SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, given by all docking score values being <−13 kcal·mol−1. QSARIS and ADMET predicted their bio- and pharma-favored properties. Conclusion The consistency of a variety of computational outputs justifies the dietary–supplemental potential of garlic essential oil based on its organosulfur ingredients.}

abstract = {The aim of this study was to describe and compare perceptions of critical thinking, attitudes to and availability of research, research utilization and barriers to this among nursing students in Scandinavia and Indonesia. Data were collected at the beginning, middle and end of education from nursing students in Norway, Sweden (bachelor’s diploma) and Banda Aceh (bachelor’s diploma). Critical Thinking and Research Utilization Questionnaires were used along with the Barrier Scale. Descriptive analyses, comparisons between and within groups were performed. At the end of education, all samples exhibited positive attitudes to research and the main barrier was related to the setting. Scandinavian students reported higher critical thinking. Indonesian students perceived greater barriers on two Barrier subscales. No differences were found between the samples regarding research utilization. Significant changes over time varied among the samples except for the Norwegian sample. Indonesian students (diploma) exhibited most changes over time. Teachers must support nursing students to strengthen their critical thinking ability and develop professional competence.}

abstract = {Based on the open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) platform, OpenFOAM, two numerical simulation methods for gusty inflow characterization and gust response prediction are implemented by solving the fundamental incompressible unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes (URANS) equations. One is the Field Velocity Method (FVM) and the other is the Oscillating Vane Method (OVM). The gust velocity field is characterized and the aerodynamic responses of some airfoils under the Sears-type sinusoidal gusts are predicted by both gust simulation methods. The results indicate that both methods are capable of obtaining satisfactory gusty inflow conditions as expected as well as the airfoil aerodynamic responses. Comparatively, from the perspective of computing cost, the FVM is more advantageous in reducing the computational resources than the OVM while simultaneously ensuring the computational accuracy.}

abstract = {Many countries and regions have reached a consensus to promote science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education in the past decade. A body of studies have demonstrated that the design and organization of interdisciplinary teaching activities are important for the effective implementation of STEM education. So far, however, little attention has been paid to the taxonomy of teaching models in STEM education. This paper aims to propose a taxonomy based on the dimensions of learning outcomes (i.e., product-oriented and knowledge-oriented) and teaching process (i.e., forward teaching model and reverse teaching model) in STEM education. Through the intersection of the above two dimensions, four teaching models in STEM education have emerged, including project-based learning (PBL), reverse engineering (RE), scientific inquiry (SI), and troubleshooting/debugging (T/D). In addition, four cases are introduced to explain how these four teaching models operate in STEM education. The implications of this work for future research are also discussed. It is promising that the study will be valuable to enrich the current research, and shed light on the theory and practice of STEM education.}
