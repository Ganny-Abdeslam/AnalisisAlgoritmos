abstract = {The major objective of this study is to develop a computational fatigue test method for welded structures. The damage mechanics approach is used to derive explicit expressions for fatigue life estimation within the framework of continuum mechanics. Microdamage model is applied to calculate the quasi-brittle material damage prior to the crack initiation. Based on the two-scale model, that is, micro versus meso (macro) scale linkage scheme is implemented in conjunction with finite element method to describe the crack initiation or propagation. For the material damage model used at microscale, a finite element code is developed. Lemaitre’s unified damage model and constitutive equation were chosen so as to ensure the efficiency for developing finite element algorithm. Identification method for material parameters required to constitutive equation is proposed using inversion of Ramberg-Osgood type constitutive model. In order to consider weld-induced residual stresses, the Ueda’s inherent strain scheme is incorporated into the calculation of residual stresses. Computational procedure based on two-scale model with the use of commercial finite element code is successfully constructed. The numerical results obtained by proposed method are compared with experimental results for validation.}

abstract = {Abstract The present paper discusses the basic principles of hydraulic turbines, with special emphasis on the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) as a tool which is being increasingly applied to gain insight into the complex three-dimensional (3D) phenomena occurring in these types of fluid machinery. The basic fluid mechanics is briefly treated for the three main types of hydraulic turbine: Pelton, Francis and axial turbines. From the vast number of applications where CFD has proven to be an important help to the design engineer, two examples have been chosen for a detailed discussion. The first example gives a comparison of experimental data and 3D Euler and 3D Navier-Stokes results for the flow in a Francis runner. The second example highlights the state-of-the-art of predicting the performance of an entire Francis turbine by means of numerical simulation.}

abstract = {There has been limited use of ceramic materials for all-ceramic posterior bridges. Major reasons are the low strength, the strength scatter, and the time-dependent strength decrease of ceramics due to slow crack growth. The objective of this study was to predict the long-term failure probability and loading capability of all-ceramic bridges (Empress 1, Empress 2, In-Ceram Alumina, and ZrO2) by computational techniques. The lifetimes of different bridge model designs were predicted by means of the NASA post-processor CARES. Bridges made of zirconia showed a very high mechanical long-term reliability. Empress I and InCeram Alumina seem to be insufficient as posterior bridge materials based on this prediction. The lifetime of the all-ceramic bridges can be significantly increased by improving the design in the connector area. We conclude that computational techniques can help to judge a ceramic material and a specific ceramic bridge design with respect to mechanical reliability before clinical use.}

abstract = {Abstract The present paper reviews tribological phenomena in metal machining from computational aspects. Emphasis is laid on the interaction between the mechanical aspects of tribology and the characteristics of the cutting process. Firstly, the fundamentals of the mechanics and physics of cutting processes are outlined. This is extended to friction and lubrication at the tool-workpiece interface and tool wear. On the basis of this quantitative knowledge, the interaction of tribology with a cutting process is demonstrated by means of computer simulation including machinability of free-cutting steels, cutting fluid action and prediction of tool wear. Finally, concluding remarks are devoted to the interaction of tribology with wider aspects of cutting towards the goal of ‘better machining‘.}

abstract = {A computational model of attention and situation awareness (SA) was developed and used to predict pilot errors in the task of taxiing from runway to terminal. The model incorporates a low-level perception/attention module and a higher-level belief-updating module. Attentional scanning is controlled by bottom-up and top-down processes, with the effectiveness of top-down guidance varying as a function of SA. Information sampled by the low-level module is fed forward to the higher-level module for consolidation within a working memory representation of the pilot’s situation, with the quality of this representation reflecting the pilot’s level of SA. The model was validated by comparing its predictions to the behavior of pilots performing a taxiway simulation. Results indicate that the model successfully predicts the improved performance associated with display augmentations, and provides construct validity regarding the effects of visibility, distraction, and degraded information quality.}

abstract = {Following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010, a substantial body of research has focused on the development of computational tools and analytical frameworks for modeling oil spill events. Much of this work is dedicated to deepening our understanding of the interactions between oil, fragile ecosystems, and the environment, as well as the impacts of oil on human settlements which are vulnerable to spill events. These advances in oil spill modeling and associated analytics have not only increased the efficiency of spill interdiction and mitigation efforts, they have also helped to nurture proactive, versus reactive, response strategies and plans for local and regional stakeholders. The purpose of this paper is to provide a progress report on the wide range of computational tools, analytical frameworks, and emerging technologies which are necessary inputs for a complete oil spill modeling package. Specifically, we explore the use of relatively mature tools, such as dedicated spill modeling packages, geographic information systems (GIS), and remote sensing, as well emerging technologies such as aerial and aquatic drones and other in-situ sensing technologies. The integration of these technologies and the advantages associated with using a geographic lens for oil spill modeling are discussed.}

The widespread examination of UCs across different disciplines leads to a variety of terms and constructs and thus a missing clarity about the discussed topics. With this computational scoping review, we uncovered six relevant, overarching topics and their development in the field. Due to the combination of an automatic text analysis via structural topic modeling and a qualitative evaluation, we were able to describe the current state of UC research and found an inherently interdisciplinary body of literature. We observed an inter- and intradisciplinary fragmentation and call for a systematization of the used terms, constructs, and examined topics.}

abstract = {A chaff cloud is an electronic countermeasure to radio frequency emitters. The cloud immerses a protected entity in a multitude of false targets by reradiating incident electromagnetic energy from millions of thin aluminized fibers, foil strips, or elements printed with conductive ink. The elements are cut to form resonant structures to match the principle threat frequencies, making them an effective reradiator. Empirically testing chaff clouds is technically challenging, costly, and time consuming. With an increased emphasis on chaff research comes the need to characterize cloud radar cross-section performance to expand existing knowledge and explore development opportunities for future technologies. This paper describes the computational methodology and results for analyzing standard dipole chaff clouds and Koch snowflakes as a possible new chaff element.}

abstract = {Relatively little attention has been paid to the venous system and valves from a cardiovascular engineering perspective up to now. Given the involvement of venous valve haemodynamics in the development of deep vein thrombosis this is an area that needs more detailed investigation and close collaboration between clinicians and cardiovascular engineers. The purpose of this review article is to provide an indication of the physiological conditions that need to be included in any computational model of the venous system, based on recommendations from clinicians, and to summarize published computational models of the venous system by trying to explore their limitations and application range. A MEDLINE search was carried out on the relevant literature from 1940 until today. Several models have been developed with a specific purpose in mind to coincide with the aim of each individual study. The model complexity and laws used in each model vary significantly. There are more simplistic computational models based on electric circuit analogies, termed as lumped parameter models, which can be used to provide boundary conditions to one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) domain models, followed by 1D continuous models based on analytical equations, which allow the description of pressure wave and can be non-linear in nature. Finally, there are the more advanced 3D models, which are based on the principles of haemodynamics, and consider the compliance of the venous system and the effect that venous valves have on the cardiovascular system. In conclusion, it appears that computer modelling of the venous system can contribute greatly to our understanding of venous physiology and allow us to evaluate the haemodynamic interactions that occur in the venous system under different physiological conditions.}
