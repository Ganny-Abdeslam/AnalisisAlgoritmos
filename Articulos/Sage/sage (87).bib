abstract = {This article presents a numerical study of ventilation performance of balconies using computational fluid dynamics. The pressure coefficients distributed on the opposite walls of a five-storey building model, both with and without balconies, were studied under variation of the wind direction, balcony dimensions and building height. The effect of balconies on the capacity for wind-induced natural ventilation is discussed. The numerical results show good agreement with the experiments of Chand et al. They also indicate that a balcony enhances the cross-ventilation of intermediate floors but weakens that of the ground and top floors, by significantly changing the pressure distribution on the windward wall. Finally, the ventilation performance of a balcony is not greatly affected by variations in its size but is slightly weakened as the height of the building increases. Practical application: This study provides information and guidance in how best to incorporate the use of a balcony in building development at the design stage.}

abstract = {Abstract This article addresses two modelling aspects of wind turbine aerofoil aerodyna-mics based on the solution of the Reynolds-averaged Navier—Stokes (RANS) equations. One of these is the effect of an a priori method for structured grid adaptation aimed at improving the wake resolution. The presented results emphasize that the proposed adaptation strategy greatly improves the wake resolution in the far field, whereas the wake is completely diffused by the non-adapted grid with the same number and spacing patterns of grid nodes. The proposed adaptation approach can be easily included in the structured generation process of both commercial and in-house-structured mesh generators. The other numerical aspect examined herein is the impact of particular choices for turbulence modelling on the predicted solution. This includes the comparative analysis of numerical solutions obtained by using different turbulence models, and also aims at quantifying the solution inaccuracy arising from not modelling the laminar-to-turbulent transition. It is found that the drag forces obtained by considering the flow as transitional or fully turbulent may differ by 50 per cent. All these issues are investigated using a special-purpose hyperbolic grid generator and two multi block structured finite volume RANS codes. The numerical experiments consider the flow field past a wind turbine aerofoil for which an exhaustive campaign of steady and unsteady experimental measurements was conducted. The predictive capabilities of the CFD solvers are validated by comparing experimental data and numerical predictions for selected flow regimes. The incompressible analysis and design code XFOIL is also used to support the findings of the comparative analysis of numerical RANS-based results and experimental data.}

abstract = {We report on our experiences in building a computational environment for tomographic image analysis for marine seismologists studying the structure and evolution of mid- ocean ridge volcanism. The computational environment is determined by an evolving set of requirements for this problem domain and includes needs for high performance parallel computing, large data analysis, model visualiza tion, and computation interaction and control. Although these needs are not unique in scientific computing, the integration of techniques for seismic tomography with tools for parallel computing and data analysis into a com putational environment was (and continues to be) an interesting, important learning experience for researchers in both disciplines. For the geologists, the use of the environment led to fundamental geologic discoveries on the East Pacific Rise, the improvement of parallel ray-trac ing algorithms, and a better regard for the use of compu tational steering in aiding model convergence. The com puter scientists received valuable feedback on the use of programming, analysis, and visualization tools in the en vironment. In particular, the tools for parallel program data query (DAQV) and visualization programming (Viz) were demonstrated to be highly adaptable to the problem do main. We discuss the requirements and the components of the environment in detail. Both accomplishments and limitations of our work are presented.}

abstract = {An analysis of a lubricated conformal contact is carried out to study the effect of surface texture on bearing friction and load carrying capacity using computational fluid dynamics. The work focuses on a journal bearing with several dimples. Two- and three-dimensional bearing geometries are considered. The full Navier—Stokes equations are solved under steady-state conditions with a multi-phase flow cavitation model. The coefficient of friction can be reduced if a texture of suitable geometry is introduced. This can be achieved either in the region of maximum hydrodynamic pressure for a bearing with high eccentricity ratio or just downstream of the maximum film for a bearing with low eccentricity ratio. An additional pressure build-up produced as a result of the surface texture has been shown at low eccentricity ratios.}

abstract = {Through an investigation of patterns of use of the location-based social network Foursquare derived from an extensive ethnographic survey of users, this paper focuses on the orientation of users towards location-based social media and mobile computational devices. Utilising Heidegger’s notions of mood and attunement to the world, the paper argues that the towards-which of the user, that is the mood of the user in a phenomenological sense, is critical to their experience of using location-based social media and the revealing of place that emerges from that usage. A contrast between a technological and a poetic or computational revealing of place can then be established based on the phenomenological orientation of user to device, application and world. The emphasis on orientation and attunement has implications for application design and research on user experience.}

abstract = {This paper examines the prevalence of bias in artificial intelligence text-to-image models utilized in the architecture and design disciplines. The rapid pace of advancements in machine learning technologies, particularly in text-to-image generators, has significantly increased over the past year, making these tools more accessible to the design community. Accordingly, this paper aims to critically document and analyze the collective, computational, and cognitive biases that designers may encounter when working with these tools at this time. The paper delves into three hierarchical levels of operation and investigates the possible biases present at each level. Starting with the training data for large language models (LLM), the paper explores how these models may create biases privileging English-language users and perspectives. The paper subsequently investigates the digital materiality of models and how their weights generate specific aesthetic results. Finally, the report concludes by examining user biases through their prompt and image selections and the potential for platforms to perpetuate these biases through the application of user data during training.}

abstract = {In recent years, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques have attracted enormous interest in the throughflow calculations, and one of the major concerns in the CFD-based throughflow method is the modeling of blade forces. In this article, a viscous blade force model in the CFD-based throughflow program was proposed to account for the loss generation. The throughflow code is based on the axisymmetric Navier–Stokes equations. The inviscid blade force is determined by calculating a pressure difference between the pressure and suction surfaces, and the viscous blade force is related to the local kinetic energy through a skin friction coefficient. The viscous blade force model was validated by a linear controlled diffusion airfoil cascade, and the results showed that it can correctly introduce the loss into the CFD-based throughflow model. Then, the code was applied to calculate the transonic NASA rotor 67, and the calculated results were in good agreement with the measured results, which showed that the calculated shock losses reduce the dependence of the throughflow calculation on the empirical correlation. Last, the 3.5-stage compressor P&W3S1 at 85%, 100%, and 105% of the design speed was performed to demonstrate the reliability of the viscous blade force model in a multistage environment. The results showed that the CFD-based throughflow method can easily predict the spanwise mixing due to the inclusion of the turbulence model, and predicted results were in acceptable agreement with the experimental results. In a word, the proposed viscous blade force model and CFD-based throughflow model can achieve the throughflow analysis with an acceptable level of accuracy and a little time-consuming.}

abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder contributing to nearly 70% of dementia cases. However, no diagnostic protein biomarkers are available in urine. In this study, we combined computational and experimental methods to identify urinary biomarkers for AD. First, by analyzing brain tissue-based gene expression data of AD, 2,754 differentially expressed genes were identified, 559 of which were predicted to encode urine-excretory proteins that might act as candidate protein biomarkers of AD. GO enrichment analyses implied that they were mainly involved in microtubule-based process, myelin sheath, and calcium ion binding, suggesting that they might be associated with AD pathogenesis. In order to verify these proteins in urine, an iTRAQ experiment was carried out to analyze urine samples from AD patients and healthy controls, and 15 proteins were detected. Based on the expression changes of these proteins, 4 proteins were chosen for further validation by ELISA experiment, and SPP1, GSN, and IGFBP7 were found to be differentially expressed in the urine of AD patients. After a literature survey, we found that they were involved in AD pathophysiology and might serve as new urine biomarkers for AD. To our knowledge, this is the first time that urine biomarkers for AD were identified by combining computational and experimental methods. Furthermore, this is the first time SPP1, GSN, and IGFBP7 have been reported as potential urine protein biomarkers for AD. Therefore, our findings might provide significant guidance for finding early biomarkers of AD in urine.}
