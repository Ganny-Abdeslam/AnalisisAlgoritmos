abstract = {Highlights We live in a technology-driven age, so the education field must rationally consider chatbots powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Faced with increasing application of AI in education, teachers should be reflective educators, and students should be self-educators. AI chatbots will evolve into a new prosthesis before being institutionalized into the fabric of school education. Reflective educators, institutionalized educators, self-educators foreshadow the future rise of hybrid educators.}

abstract = {Pregnancy can be accompanied by serious health risks to mother and child, such as pre-eclampsia, premature birth and postpartum haemorrhage. Understanding of the normal physiology of uterine function is essential to an improved management of such risks. Here we focus on the physiology of the smooth muscle fibres which make up the bulk of the uterine wall and which generate the forceful contractions that accompany parturition. We survey computational methods that integrate mathematical modelling with data analysis and thereby aid the discovery of new therapeutic targets that, according to clinical needs, can be manipulated to either stop contractions or cause the uterine wall muscle to become active.}

abstract = {Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is commonly associated with decision-making, neurocognitive impairments, and mood and motivational symptoms. However, their relationship may be obscured by traditional scoring methods. Objectives: To study the computational basis underlying decision-making impairments in MS and their interaction with neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric measures. Methods: Twenty-nine MS patients and 26 matched control subjects completed a computer version of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Participants underwent neurocognitive evaluation using an expanded version of the Brief Repeatable Battery. Hierarchical Bayesian Analysis was used to estimate three established computational models to compare parameters between groups. Results: Patients showed increased learning rate and reduced loss-aversion during decision-making relative to control subjects. These alterations were associated with: (1) reduced net gains in the IGT; (2) processing speed, executive functioning and memory impairments; and (3) higher levels of depression and current apathy. Conclusion: Decision-making deficits in MS patients could be described by the interplay between latent computational processes, neurocognitive impairments, and mood/motivational symptoms.}

abstract = {In this dialogue, Phillip Howard introduces “computational propaganda” as an emerging communication tool in political communication and a perspective for investigating misinformation and disinformation. By articulating the concepts, patterns, and mechanisms of computational propaganda, Howard proposes a socio-technical framework for studying computational propaganda. He calls for mixed methods to undertake computational research alongside qualitative investigation, thus addressing the computational as well as the political. Howard emphasizes the battle against algorithm bias, manipulation, and misinformation, and he advocates building an International Panel on the Information Environment (IPIE), an international scientific collaboration, to respond to the challenges. In addition, Howard offers advice on further research in computational propaganda.}

abstract = {Small group researchers are increasingly called to engage the computational sciences. One challenge in answering this call is the lack of information concerning what the study of small groups looks like in these domains. This paper addresses this challenge through a prospecting review of research that computationally models or trains computers to learn small group and team behavior and is published in computing disciplines from 2016 to 2023. This review investigated how groups were modeled, for what purpose, what group elements were modeled, and whether social science informed the model design. Qualitative methods were used to analyze 119 published articles. Suggestions are presented for increasing the influence of small group research on the computational modeling of groups and teams, particularly for researchers with limited access to large research teams or resources. This review helps bridge the gap between small group research and computational sciences to advance the understanding of small groups and teams.}

abstract = {This commentary advances the ‘hack’ as an urban concept. While the hack transcends existing literatures on the digital and informality, it is a distinctive concept and is being used systematically in new domains. I situate the hack conceptually, outline its empirical and methodological value and propose a framework to research the urban hack. Importantly, it is not just the technologies of hacking but the translation of computational logics to the urban that underpins the importance of the hack, as well as the critical need to set out a research agenda surrounding the hack within urban studies.}

abstract = {Multiphysics modeling, code development, and validation by full-scale experiments is presented for hydrodynamic/suspension-dynamic interactions of a novel ocean vehicle, the Wave Adaptive Modular Vessel (WAM-V). The boat is a pontoon catamaran with hinged engine pods and elevated payload supported by suspension and articulation systems. Computational fluid dynamics models specific to WAM-V are developed which include hinged pod dynamics, water-jet propulsion modeling, and immersed boundary method for flow in the gap between pontoon and pod. Multi-body dynamics modeling for the suspension and upper-structure dynamic is developed in MATLAB Simulink. Coupled equations of motion are developed and solved iteratively through either one-way or two-way coupling methods to converge on flow-field, pontoon motions, pod motions, waterjet forces, and suspension motions. Validation experiments include cylinder drop with suspended mass and 33-feet WAM-V sea-trials in calm water and waves. Computational results show that two-way coupling is necessary to capture the physics of the interactions. The experimental trends are predicted well and errors are mostly comparable to those for rigid boats, however, in some cases the errors are larger, which is expected due to the complexity of the current studies. Ride quality analyses show that WAM-V suspension is effective in reducing payload vertical accelerations in waves by 73% compared to the same boat with rigid upper-structure.}

abstract = {Purpose: This article aims to shed light on a latest education informatization policy blueprint in China, titled Education Informatization 2.0 Action Plan, which was promulgated by the Ministry of Education in China on April 18, 2018. Design/Approach/Methods: The study is an analytical policy review based on the policy documents, theoretical discussion, and development of practice. Findings: This new Chinese education informatization policy was driven by three factors: the promotion of education informatization 1.0 in China, the requirement of education modernization toward 2035, and the response to “Wisdom Education.” The framework for action can be summarized as “One Goal, Three Tasks, and Eight Actions.” The main features involve innovation-driven development rather than technology-driven development, committing to the expansion of digital educational resources rather than the digital presentation of textbooks, and aiming at improving teachers and students’ information literacy rather than the applied skills of information technology. The future vision of the plan involves building new models on talent cultivation, education service, and education governance. The new models on talent cultivation involve establishing “Wisdom Teaching” mode, learning mode, and intelligent learning environment supported by artificial intelligence technology. The new education service models entail building the admission and sharing mechanism of quality educational resources based on National Network for Education and the public service platform and system for educational resources by means of the cloud computing and artificial intelligence. The new education governance models involve achieving precise, flat, and humanized education governance. Originality/Value: This article entails expounding the motivation, framework for action, main features, and vision of the education informatization 2.0 in China, which will be helpful for learning and understanding the current background, stage, and future path of China’s education informatization.}
